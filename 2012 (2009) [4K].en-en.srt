1
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,735
Hey, hey, watch out. Watch out.

2
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:48,657
Welcome, my friend.

3
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:49,909
Great to see you.

4
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,952
Yeah, glad you made it.

5
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:55,372
This can't be Ajit.
He's a little man already.

6
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,875
- Unbelievable.
- I hope you're hungry, Adrian.

7
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:00,336
I'm famished. How are you, Aparna?

8
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:03,005
- I made that fish curry you love.
- I can't wait.

9
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:06,675
She gets more beautiful
every time I see her. Why is that?

10
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:10,513
Strange, isn't it?
But her fish curry is still awful.

11
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,184
You were mysterious on the phone.
Why didn't you attend the conference?

12
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:19,188
- I will show you, Adrian, sir.
- Satnam, stop "siring" me.

13
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,905
How deep do we need to go?

14
00:02:28,073 --> 00:02:29,448
Eleven thousand feet.

15
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:33,077
I searched all over India
for this thing.

16
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,038
Used to be the deepest copper mine
in the world.

17
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,003
Remember my brother, Gurdeep?
He's a student now.

18
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:45,089
Namaste, Dr. Helmsley, sir.

19
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:47,716
Adrian. It's just Adrian.

20
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,471
Just don't pour too much, huh?

21
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,725
How do you work in this heat?

22
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,602
You've come on a good day,
my friend.

23
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,730
Sometimes it can hit 120 degrees.

24
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,191
You have to come and meet
Dr. Lokesh...

25
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:07,153
...a Fellow of quantum physics
at the university in Chennai.

26
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,280
Dr. Helmsley.

27
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:13,701
So, what are we looking at?

28
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:15,578
These are neutrinos acting normally.

29
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:18,747
Minuscule mass,
no electrical charge.

30
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:21,417
They pass through ordinary matter
almost undisturbed.

31
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:24,670
Your message said the count doubled
after the last solar eruptions.

32
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,839
That was last week.

33
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,217
But this happened two days ago.

34
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:37,892
The biggest Sun eruptions
in human history...

35
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:41,103
...causing the highest neutrino count
we've ever recorded.

36
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,606
My God.

37
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,486
That's not what worries me, Adrian.

38
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:51,947
For the first time ever...

39
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,659
...the neutrinos are causing
a physical reaction.

40
00:03:58,163 --> 00:04:00,289
That's impossible.

41
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:06,295
That feels very good.

42
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:10,716
Please, follow me.

43
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:16,347
You won't believe this.

44
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:21,644
This water tank goes down
another 6000 feet.

45
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:25,105
It looks like the neutrinos
coming from the Sun...

46
00:04:25,273 --> 00:04:28,818
...have mutated into a new kind
of nuclear particle.

47
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:38,327
They're heating up
the Earth's core...

48
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:41,330
...and suddenly act like microwaves.

49
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:57,471
Ladies and gentlemen,
as promised, no speech...

50
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,516
...just a thank-you...

51
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:03,435
...because tonight,
with your extraordinary generosity...

52
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:07,273
...we have raised $1.7 million.

53
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,693
Have a stiff drink,
because I'm locking the doors...

54
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:13,946
- ... and passing the hat around again.
- It's okay. It's okay.

55
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:16,115
- I work for the White House.
- I don't care.

56
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,242
This is a black-tie event.

57
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:20,161
Scotty.

58
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:24,039
Hey. Adrian, I thought you were
in India. What's going on?

59
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:25,875
- I need yourjacket.
- What?

60
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,919
I gotta speak to Anheuser.
Give me your damn jacket, please.

61
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:30,421
- All right.
- Okay?

62
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:33,257
- All right, here. Here.
- Hold that for a minute, will you?

63
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:38,637
Hey! Easy, that's a $600 jacket.

64
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:41,807
Mr. Anheuser?

65
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,225
Mr. Anheuser.

66
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,395
I need to talk to you.

67
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,649
- Do I know you?
- Sorry, sir.

68
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,234
My name's Dr. Adrian Helmsley.

69
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:56,363
I'm a deputy geologist at the Office
of Science and Technology Policy.

70
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:58,908
Excuse me, fellas.

71
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:02,995
You know that this is a fundraiser,
not a frat party, right?

72
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,581
- It's important, sir.
- You know what? It always is.

73
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:08,250
Make an appointment with my...
You know, even better:

74
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:10,961
Have your boss bring it up
at the quarterly briefing.

75
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,880
There's a good plan.

76
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:15,633
I just traveled 20 straight hours
to get here, sir.

77
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:17,551
I haven't slept in two days.

78
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:21,263
You need to read this, sir.
You need to read it now.

79
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:29,855
Let me guess,
national geology crisis?

80
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,024
Excuse me.

81
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:52,628
- Who do you report to?
- Lee Cavazos.

82
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:54,755
Not anymore.

83
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:59,927
Alan, bring the car around.

84
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:02,346
- You're gonna wish you took a shower.
- Sir?

85
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:04,223
You're about to meet the president.

86
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,641
What's going on?

87
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:07,726
Get that to the office.

88
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:16,735
No G8! No G8! No G8!

89
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:38,507
Good morning.

90
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:42,219
I would like to meet privately
with my fellow heads of state.

91
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:47,850
Mr. Makarenko wishes
to have his interpreters present.

92
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:51,020
Mr. President, I can assure you...

93
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:55,691
...your English is more than sufficient
for what I have to say.

94
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,671
Mr. Presidents.

95
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:22,968
Six months ago...

96
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:27,264
...I was made aware of a situation
so devastating...

97
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:31,060
...that, at first, I refused to believe it.

98
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:33,270
However...

99
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,315
...through the concerted efforts...

100
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,026
...of our brightest scientists...

101
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:43,072
...we have confirmed its validity.

102
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,869
The world as we know it...

103
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,748
...will soon come to an end.

104
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,261
This dam project
will create many newjobs.

105
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,766
The Party and country
will assist in your relocation.

106
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,978
Grandma, give me your hand.

107
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,856
- But where are they taking us?
- It'll be all right.

108
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,320
Brother!

109
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:26,157
Grandma, I will send you money.

110
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:33,455
Who can write?

111
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,624
Who can read?

112
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:38,210
Who can weld?

113
00:10:10,952 --> 00:10:14,997
Has His Highness had an opportunity
to study the dossier?

114
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:23,088
You must understand,
I have a very big family, Mr...?

115
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,174
Isaacs.

116
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:27,843
One billion dollars is a lot of money.

117
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:33,849
I'm afraid the amount is in euros,
Your Highness.

118
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:53,619
I put a lot of faith
into your organization.

119
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:58,207
It's a perfect replica, Roland.

120
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,918
There are too many fanatics out there
that could damage her.

121
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:05,464
Just think about the beautiful Buddha
statues they blew up in Afghanistan.

122
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:10,594
Our Heritage Organization
has already made selections...

123
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:13,597
...from the British Museum
and L'Hermitage.

124
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,941
I guess she'll be safe now,
tucked away...

125
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:29,321
...hidden in some bunker
in Switzerland.

126
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:32,908
Perfectly safe, Roland.

127
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:36,996
Only infrared analysis
would reveal the difference.

128
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,416
But it's still a fake.

129
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:57,683
This mass suicide was actually
discovered by a documentary crew...

130
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,144
...here in the ancient Mayan city
of Tikal.

131
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,313
Now, the victims,
and we've seen many...

132
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:05,191
...are said to have adhered
to the Mayan-Quiche calendar...

133
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,443
...which predicts
the end of time to occur...

134
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:09,820
...on the 21st of December
of this year...

135
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:12,031
...due to the Sun's
destructive forces.

136
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,282
Thank you, Mark.

137
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,160
Strangely enough,
scientific records do support the fact...

138
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:21,415
...that we are heading for the biggest
solar climax in recorded history.

139
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:26,795
Well, yes.

140
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:30,800
Apparently many people believe
that the Mayan calendar predicts...

141
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:33,511
...that there's supposed
to be a galactic alignment...

142
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:34,720
I'm a dead man.

143
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,723
I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man.

144
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:41,185
...it's the end of the world in 2012.

145
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:43,354
Goddamn it.

146
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:51,153
Hey, Kate. I'm practically
on the freeway right now.

147
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:54,740
Yes, I'm hurtling toward you
as we speak.

148
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,077
Will you relax?
Yeah, I'll be there any second.

149
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:02,331
You know it's a vacation
and not a doctor's appointment, right?

150
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:03,999
That it's supposed to be fun?

151
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,126
You remember fun, don't you, Kate?

152
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:09,880
Do you remember where you were
when it stopped being fun for you?

153
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,509
Yeah. I got it.

154
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:21,976
Bug spray? Oh, yeah, because
it's mosquito season in Yellowstone.

155
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:26,730
I got a whole bunch. Okay, I gotta go,
because I'm in a bad-reception area.

156
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:34,530
Whoa, man.

157
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:36,490
Would you look at that?

158
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,075
Sick.

159
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,624
Merrill, I told you.

160
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,627
We have to move back
to Wisconsin.

161
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,131
Yeah, but these little mini-quakes
are really getting on my nerves.

162
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,384
A little surface crack? You're not
gonna be inconvenienced by that.

163
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:58,179
Right, surface cracks.
I got a plastic surgeon for that.

164
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:00,639
Thank God for those shake-proof
coffee mugs, Lisa.

165
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,892
They show the true nature
of us Californians.

166
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,978
We'll not bow to these inconvenient
things like surface cracks.

167
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:11,901
If you have a funny mini-quake story
and wanna share it, call 555-1070...

168
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:21,452
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, baby.

169
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:24,079
- How are you, sweetie?
- Good.

170
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:25,748
Jackson, what is this?

171
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,167
Please don't call me that.
I'm your dad.

172
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:30,419
Come on.

173
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:33,047
You're taking them camping
in a limo?

174
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:34,757
Okay, great.

175
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,550
What happened to your temp job?

176
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:39,553
Oh, you know, better hours,
more time to write.

177
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:42,473
What about sleeping? Have you
been doing any of that lately?

178
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:47,770
I've said it a thousand times, no lipo
on Fridays. It's too messy. Hold on.

179
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:49,271
- Morning, Jackson.
- Hi.

180
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:50,606
- Nice ride.
- Thanks.

181
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:52,107
Guys, have a nice trip.

182
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:54,944
Remember, watch out for the bears.
You know, they're:

183
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,320
Bye, Gordon.

184
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:58,447
- Love you, honey.
- Bye.

185
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:00,699
- Okay, so, Lil... Oh, yeah.
- You tell him.

186
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:02,535
Tell me what?

187
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,287
She needs to put these on
before she goes to sleep.

188
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:07,122
- Still?
- Yes.

189
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,835
Your 7-year-old still wets her bed.
That's something you should know.

190
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,295
- I love you.
- Love you, Mom.

191
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:15,798
- Hey.
- You okay?

192
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,386
They've been looking forward
to spending time with you.

193
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:21,637
I know.

194
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:24,682
- So don't be on your computer.
- Got it.

195
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,396
Love you.

196
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:37,486
- So this time, we hit Japan.
- So?

197
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:39,363
Well, you could visit your boy, Will.

198
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:40,865
Afternoon, ladies.

199
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:42,533
- Hello there.
- Hello, handsome.

200
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:44,076
Are you even listening to me?

201
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,828
Unfortunately, I am, Harry.

202
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:47,872
I heard from Audrey
you're a grandpa now.

203
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,499
Would you mind keeping your nose
out of my family?

204
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,586
You're cramping my style, baby.
There we are.

205
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:57,214
So he married a Japanese girl.
How is that the end of the world?

206
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:59,508
Come on, Tony.
You should at least go see him.

207
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:02,386
- You see your boy?
- Not as much as I'd like.

208
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:04,930
D.C. is a long way,
but at least we talk.

209
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,432
About what?

210
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,269
Life, and how short it is.

211
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:36,253
What the hell was that?

212
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,551
Hello?

213
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:44,386
Laura.

214
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,555
Laura, can you hear me?

215
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,432
Roland, is that you?

216
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,559
Laura, they lied to us.

217
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:52,978
I've arranged a press conference
for tomorrow.

218
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,564
I will tell everyone the truth
about what's going on.

219
00:16:55,732 --> 00:16:57,233
What are you talking about?

220
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,943
The art you collected...

221
00:16:59,694 --> 00:17:01,362
...it's not in the Alps.

222
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,905
Those tunnels are empty.

223
00:17:03,073 --> 00:17:04,156
I have proof!

224
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:07,076
Laura.

225
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:08,410
Laura, can you hear me?

226
00:17:09,204 --> 00:17:12,164
- I'm losing you. Roland?
- Laura, can you hear me?

227
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,415
Laura.

228
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:39,275
Break it down.

229
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:45,114
- I liked that song.
- We lost it.

230
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:49,076
...going on the West Coast
with all those surface cracks.

231
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:53,622
I told myself, "Charlie,
get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. "

232
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,459
I don't want to miss all the fun
when it finally blows.

233
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,920
Let me tell you,
there's been government people...

234
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:05,384
...flying in and out all morning,
and trust me, they did not look happy.

235
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,887
- Always remember folks:
- That's weird.

236
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:11,056
- You heard it first from Charlie.
- Yeah, just when he said that?

237
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:13,809
What are the odds?

238
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:16,228
We're not seeing soil liquefaction
we'd expect...

239
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,690
...or any evidence of fracture
propagation within the tectonic plates.

240
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:21,901
- In English.
- The activity on the coast...

241
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,528
...is not caused by tecto...
By regular earthquakes.

242
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:28,073
And these surface cracks have
nothing to do with shifting fault lines.

243
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:31,452
You suggesting this could be the
beginning of the Cho Ming operation?

244
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,955
Dr. Helmsley is flying to Yellowstone
this morning to collect more data.

245
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:39,168
We have been following the schedule
you established, Mr. Helmsley.

246
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:41,837
The most important schedule
in the history of mankind.

247
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:44,673
Now you're telling me
we have to throw it out?

248
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:46,467
Yes, sir.

249
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:49,345
I was wrong.

250
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:56,393
Do you know how many times
I've heard those words in this office?

251
00:18:57,062 --> 00:18:58,229
Zero.

252
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:01,857
Did you see this?

253
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:04,193
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
She insisted.

254
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:05,694
It's all over the news.

255
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:11,700
We are learning more
about this deadly car explosion.

256
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:14,578
The director
of the French National Museums...

257
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:17,873
...was to hold a press conference
at the Louvre this morning.

258
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:22,002
Coincidentally, his death took place
in the same Paris tunnel...

259
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,381
...where Princess Diana died
in 1997.

260
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:28,092
We are continuing to follow this story.
We will...

261
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:32,388
Laura, I don't believe you've met
Dr. Helmsley.

262
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:35,808
I just talked to him, Dad,
and he told me...

263
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:38,394
...that the organization
that I work for is a sham.

264
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,187
I mean, why would he say that?

265
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:46,861
You look just like your mother
when you get upset.

266
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:48,320
Did I ever tell you that?

267
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,698
Every time I get upset.

268
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,491
Daddy, a man was killed.

269
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,746
Honey, please sit down.

270
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:10,426
Only a dozen people
in this administration...

271
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:12,553
...know what I'm about to tell you.

272
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:14,805
Dad, what's going on?

273
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:23,272
An unprecedented international
endeavor is underway.

274
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,985
At this point,
46 nations are invested in this thing.

275
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:30,279
Laura's a smart girl.
She'll understand.

276
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:34,074
That thing in Paris, we're not involved
in any of that, are we?

277
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:37,661
We? Who the hell is "we"?
What are you talking about?

278
00:20:37,829 --> 00:20:40,623
We need to focus on this timeline.
That's what we need to do.

279
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,209
- When do we let the country know?
- What do you mean?

280
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:46,837
The people, sir. They need to know.

281
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:49,590
Well, of course they do.

282
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:54,178
Listen, yourjob is to figure out
when this is all gonna fall apart.

283
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:55,638
My job is to figure out...

284
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:59,141
...how to retain some semblance
of government after it falls apart.

285
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:01,393
Until then,
we don't have time for anything...

286
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,479
...except for doing those jobs. Okay?

287
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:06,148
Call me the moment you get any news
from Yellowstone.

288
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:07,316
Yes, sir.

289
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:09,568
Cute girl, huh?

290
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:11,821
- Sir?
- The First Daughter.

291
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:14,907
- I saw you looking at her.
- I wasn't looking at her.

292
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:18,410
Better move fast, kid.
The end is near.

293
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:23,123
Adrian, your chopper's ready.
They're waiting on the South Lawn.

294
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,836
Daddy, where are we going?

295
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:30,005
Going to this really special place
that I know.

296
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:33,008
It's a place where your mom and I
used to hang out a lot.

297
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:35,511
I don't wanna know
where you and Mom had sex.

298
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,222
- I'm not ready for that, Jackson.
- Stop calling me that.

299
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,559
It's creeping me out.
What's wrong with "Dad"?

300
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:43,686
- Grumpy Grumperson.
- Daddy, look at this.

301
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:46,856
That wasn't here before.

302
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,150
What do we do?

303
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:51,235
Go get your hat.

304
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:57,908
Don't you see the signs?

305
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,626
Used to be a lake here.

306
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:09,962
Doesn't look much of a lake to me.

307
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:12,715
I know,
the whole damn thing's gone.

308
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:17,136
- Come on, let's check it out.
- Grwat.

309
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,744
Subjects have now entered
hot zone.

310
00:22:55,383 --> 00:22:56,967
Who is that?

311
00:22:58,386 --> 00:22:59,678
That's the U.S. Army.

312
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:13,901
All manner of government vehicle
are converging on subjects.

313
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:15,653
You're in a restricted area, sir.

314
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:18,489
- We need you to come with us.
- Right. Right.

315
00:23:18,657 --> 00:23:20,783
Okay, we're gonna go
with these guys.

316
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:21,992
That'll be fun, huh?

317
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:27,081
This is wild.

318
00:23:27,624 --> 00:23:29,333
This is really wild.

319
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:44,431
This is unbelievable.
2700 degrees Celsius at 40,000 feet?

320
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,767
I know,
it sounds completely implausible.

321
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:49,979
Nonetheless, we're ticking off
an increase of almost 0.5 percent.

322
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,231
- Per day?
- No.

323
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:53,440
Per hour.

324
00:23:53,608 --> 00:23:56,652
Dr. Helmsley. We've arrested
a group of tourists in the hot zone.

325
00:23:56,862 --> 00:23:58,154
Okay, I'll take care of it.

326
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:00,948
Look, let's get Satnam
on the communications link.

327
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:03,075
We'll try and cross-reference
the data.

328
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:06,328
It's a national park. There's not
supposed to be posted fences.

329
00:24:06,496 --> 00:24:08,372
I mean, what's going on here?

330
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,291
We're geologists.

331
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:13,043
Do you usually go digging
with machine guns?

332
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,881
Major, I'll take care of this.
Thank you.

333
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:20,217
- What happened to the lake?
- That's what we're trying to find out.

334
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:22,511
We think the entire area
has become unstable.

335
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,723
I think you should take your kids
and leave, Mr. Curtis.

336
00:24:27,017 --> 00:24:29,393
You're not by any chance
the Jackson Curtis...

337
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:31,937
...who wrote Farewell Atlantis,
are you?

338
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:35,941
The very same.

339
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:39,195
It's actually dedicated to my mom.

340
00:24:39,863 --> 00:24:41,363
That's great.

341
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:45,451
I read a couple of your short stories
when I was in college. Yeah.

342
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,287
You know,
your father is a very talented man.

343
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:50,789
- Listen up.
- It's amazing. I'm reading your book.

344
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:54,293
I'm around day 300, the shuttle has
just lost communication with Earth.

345
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:56,378
You're one of the lucky few
who bought it.

346
00:24:56,546 --> 00:24:58,214
- I didn't buy it.
- No?

347
00:24:58,423 --> 00:25:00,049
My dad gave it to me.

348
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,927
Let me ask you something.

349
00:25:04,012 --> 00:25:06,639
You believe those people
would behave so selflessly...

350
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:08,933
...knowing that their own lives
were at stake?

351
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,518
I hope so.

352
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:13,979
The critics said I was naive,
an unabashed optimist...

353
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:15,815
...but what do they know, right?

354
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,149
Well...

355
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:19,819
- Pleasure.
- It was a great pleasure meeting you.

356
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:23,239
Major, could you escort these
good people to the campgrounds?

357
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:24,573
This is yours.

358
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:26,075
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:25:26,243 --> 00:25:27,243
- Take care.
- Okay.

360
00:25:27,494 --> 00:25:28,619
He was very nice.

361
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:31,288
You're just saying that
because he liked my book.

362
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:40,256
Looks like that boy of yours
is gonna be smarter than any of us.

363
00:25:44,886 --> 00:25:45,928
What's wrong?

364
00:25:46,096 --> 00:25:48,806
I sent Satnam
the temperature reading.

365
00:25:48,974 --> 00:25:52,852
My colleagues in Argentina and
Ontario have almost identical data.

366
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,437
It's so hot here,
we've had to seal off the mine.

367
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:58,274
- Double-checked the numbers?
- Triple-checked, my friend.

368
00:25:58,441 --> 00:26:00,776
I wish we were wrong...

369
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:02,528
...but we're not.

370
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,614
The Earth's crust is destabilizing.

371
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:12,079
It's too early.

372
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:15,791
Adrian,
you have to begin the evacuation.

373
00:26:17,544 --> 00:26:19,128
My God.

374
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:23,090
All our scientific advances,
our fancy machines...

375
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:26,135
The Mayans saw this coming
thousands of years ago.

376
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:37,521
I thought we'd have more time.

377
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,072
Okay.

378
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:49,158
I want you to pack up your family.

379
00:26:49,326 --> 00:26:51,952
I'm gonna arrange an airlift for you
from Delhi.

380
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,787
Thank you, my friend.

381
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:55,581
And good luck.

382
00:27:04,674 --> 00:27:06,008
Ajit.

383
00:27:07,344 --> 00:27:09,178
We are going on a big ship.

384
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:15,017
- That was so cool.
- Yeah, that was intense.

385
00:27:15,185 --> 00:27:17,353
- The helicopters.
- Craziest place I've seen.

386
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:21,190
- Those helicopters were so cool.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

387
00:27:21,358 --> 00:27:23,359
Wait. Sorry. One question:

388
00:27:24,152 --> 00:27:28,781
What did the government guys
say to you?

389
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:34,537
Well, they don't like us
going over their fences...

390
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:38,707
...and that the whole area
back there is unstable.

391
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:41,544
Unstable. They said "unstable"?

392
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:42,795
Yeah, unstable.

393
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:46,715
That's funny.

394
00:27:46,883 --> 00:27:49,135
Let's go. Have a good one.

395
00:27:51,638 --> 00:27:53,973
Unstable.

396
00:27:58,895 --> 00:28:00,771
It's not just Yellowstone, sir.

397
00:28:00,939 --> 00:28:03,566
Temperatures are rising
with incredible velocity...

398
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:05,317
...in hot zones across the globe.

399
00:28:05,485 --> 00:28:07,778
Are you absolutely sure
about this, Adrian?

400
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:09,613
Because once we give
these orders...

401
00:28:09,781 --> 00:28:11,949
...there's no going back.
You understand that?

402
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:15,035
I'm afraid there's no longer
any doubt, sir.

403
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:19,582
We have to save what we can.
And we have to move now!

404
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:52,698
There's mosquitoes in here.
Did anybody spray the tent?

405
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:55,284
I'm gonna get that spray tomorrow.

406
00:28:55,452 --> 00:28:58,454
They just like you
because your blood's so sweet.

407
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:02,041
Dad, you said you wouldn't work
on your book.

408
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:05,669
What, Lil'bee? I'm not, I'm not.
I'm just... I'm doing something else.

409
00:29:06,171 --> 00:29:09,131
Let me get you ready for...
Ready for bed.

410
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:10,966
Okay.

411
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:15,471
Did you really need all these hats?

412
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,390
- Where are your Pull-Ups, sweetie?
- I have them on.

413
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:27,316
Who gave you this, Mommy?

414
00:29:27,484 --> 00:29:30,236
No, Gordon gave it to me
for my birthday.

415
00:29:30,403 --> 00:29:34,156
A cell phone is something we gotta
talk about, you know, as a family.

416
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:36,492
What family?

417
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:43,749
That hurts my feelings
when you say stuff like that.

418
00:29:45,961 --> 00:29:47,002
Just go away.

419
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,092
Adults get...

420
00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:56,053
...hurt feelings too.

421
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:07,815
We have a listener calling in.

422
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:11,026
Bill from Cooke City,
you're on the Charlie Frost Show.

423
00:30:11,194 --> 00:30:13,237
Charlie, just wanted to say
I love your show.

424
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:14,530
No way.

425
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:16,323
...not afraid to tell the truth.

426
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:18,325
Thank you, Bill.
What is your question?

427
00:30:18,493 --> 00:30:20,703
I wanted to know,
where is all this gonna start?

428
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:24,206
Well, something like this could only
originate in Hollywood, Bill.

429
00:30:24,374 --> 00:30:26,917
They got the Earth
cracking under their asses already.

430
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:30,004
Our family believes in the gospel
of the Lord Jesus.

431
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:33,757
- We have nothing to fear, Charlie.
- Good for you, Bill. Thanks for calling.

432
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:38,721
This is Charlie Frost reporting live
from Yellowstone National Park...

433
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:43,976
...soon to become
the world's largest active volcano.

434
00:30:44,478 --> 00:30:46,395
I'll be right back, folks.

435
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:52,443
Do you mind if I join you?
I wanted to ask you something.

436
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:54,153
I only got a minute.

437
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:56,155
Hey. Pickle?

438
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:59,909
No. I was listening to the broadcast
and I was wondering...

439
00:31:00,076 --> 00:31:03,871
...what exactly is it
that's gonna start in Hollywood?

440
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,915
It's the apocalypse.

441
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:07,833
End of days.

442
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:11,545
The Judgment Day,
the end of the world, my friend.

443
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:15,174
Christians called it the rapture,
but the Mayans knew about it...

444
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:18,594
...the Hopis, the I Ching...

445
00:31:18,804 --> 00:31:20,429
...the Bible, kind of...

446
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:22,640
Beer?

447
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:25,810
- Yeah.
- So look, I gotta eat.

448
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:29,814
Why don't you download my blog.
It's free.

449
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:33,275
Of course,
we do appreciate donations.

450
00:31:33,443 --> 00:31:37,613
In ancient times, the Mayan people
were the first civilization to discover...

451
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:40,282
...that this planet had
an expiration date.

452
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,951
According to their calendar...

453
00:31:42,118 --> 00:31:45,621
...in the year 2012,
a cataclysmic event will unfold...

454
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:48,666
...caused by an alignment
of the planets in our solar system...

455
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:52,962
...that only happens
every 640,000 years.

456
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:54,797
Oh, not again.

457
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:58,717
Pretty neat, huh?
I did all the animation myself.

458
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:02,138
Just imagine the Earth
as an orange.

459
00:32:02,806 --> 00:32:07,017
You lure them in with humor.
Then you make them think.

460
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:10,855
Our sun will begin to emit
such extreme amounts of radiation...

461
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:13,232
Those little bastards
are called neutrinos.

462
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,069
...that the core of the Earth will melt.
That's the inside part of the orange...

463
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:20,406
...leaving the crust of our planet
free to shift.

464
00:32:20,574 --> 00:32:25,327
In 1958, Professor Charles Hapgood
named it Earth Crust Displacement.

465
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:28,497
Albert Einstein did support it.

466
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:29,832
People, we'll get it all.

467
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,877
The forces of Mother Nature
will be so devastating...

468
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:38,924
...it will bring an end to this world
on winter solstice, 12-21-12.

469
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:43,179
Always remember, folks,
you heard it first from Charlie Frost.

470
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,682
You'd have to keep a thing like this
under wraps.

471
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:48,934
I mean, just think about it, okay?

472
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:51,687
First, the stock market would go.

473
00:32:51,897 --> 00:32:54,148
Then the economy, boom!

474
00:32:54,316 --> 00:32:55,608
The dollar, boom!

475
00:32:55,775 --> 00:33:00,863
And then pandemonium in the streets.
War, genocide, boom, boom, boom!

476
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:04,617
Bullshit. Nobody could keep
that big a secret, Charlie.

477
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:07,536
- Somebody would blow the whistle.
- Every once in a while...

478
00:33:07,704 --> 00:33:09,705
...some poor little sucker tries.

479
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:12,625
Well, like these guys, boom, boom!

480
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:16,462
Every one of these guys,
dead, dead, dead.

481
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:21,467
That's Professor Meyers.

482
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:24,470
He ran the Atlantis shuttle program.
Why, did you know him?

483
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:27,056
Yeah, he helped me
with research on my book.

484
00:33:27,224 --> 00:33:29,809
Well, that must have been
before his "accident. "

485
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:31,101
Meyers is dead?

486
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:34,021
Oh, yeah, two months ago.

487
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:36,941
He was one
of my most avid listeners...

488
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:39,068
...and he had it all figured out.

489
00:33:39,236 --> 00:33:42,571
Everything the government was doing,
where and why...

490
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:44,949
He even sent me a map.

491
00:33:45,826 --> 00:33:49,036
A map for what, Charlie?
What's the map for?

492
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:59,755
They're building spaceships, man.

493
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,596
Shit, man, I have to go...

494
00:34:07,764 --> 00:34:11,058
...because I gotta get back to Earth.

495
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:13,936
- But do you got a traveler for the road?
- This is my last...

496
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:17,273
Oh, that'll be all right. But, anyway,
I really enjoyed most of this.

497
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,607
Thank you so much.

498
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:20,609
Hey. Hey, guess what.

499
00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:23,487
- They're selling seats.
- Put me down for three.

500
00:34:23,655 --> 00:34:25,781
No, guys like you and me
don't have a chance.

501
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:28,409
You'd have to be Bill Gates
or Rupert Murdoch...

502
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:30,578
...or some Russian billionaire
or something.

503
00:34:30,745 --> 00:34:32,454
Keep it down, my kids are sleeping.

504
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:35,374
Get them out of Yellowstone.

505
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:37,793
It's gonna get ugly here.

506
00:34:41,798 --> 00:34:43,966
Why don't we make a baby?

507
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:48,512
We're not making a baby
in the supermarket.

508
00:34:49,097 --> 00:34:52,600
Hey, hands off the merchandise.

509
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:57,271
Honey, women pay me thousands
of dollars to handle their boobs.

510
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:58,647
You get it for free.

511
00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:19,793
You always act strange
after he shows up.

512
00:35:19,961 --> 00:35:23,172
I'm not acting strange.
I'm looking for the macaroni.

513
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:28,469
So why did you
stick with him so long?

514
00:35:28,637 --> 00:35:31,764
Can we just give it a rest, please?
He's the father of my children.

515
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:33,432
Oh, come on, Kate.

516
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,768
You gave up med school
so you could have Noah.

517
00:35:35,936 --> 00:35:38,437
You practically raised
him and Lilly by yourself...

518
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:40,314
...while he sat writing that junk.

519
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:42,775
It's not junk. He's published.

520
00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:44,568
Oh, published, right, I forgot.

521
00:35:44,736 --> 00:35:47,196
Four hundred
and twenty-two copies.

522
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:02,878
Did you see that?

523
00:36:03,046 --> 00:36:05,381
See what? Hey, Kate.

524
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:09,468
Listen, we have to keep
working at this, our relationship.

525
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:13,889
I mean, I don't know, honey. I just feel
like there's something pulling us apart.

526
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:18,602
Gordon!

527
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,396
Hang on! Hang onto the pole!

528
00:36:21,231 --> 00:36:22,481
Kate. Don't let go.

529
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:23,899
- Oh, my God.
- Hang on!

530
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:25,067
Gordon!

531
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,904
Do you have anything
for mosquito bites?

532
00:36:29,072 --> 00:36:30,906
Before or after?

533
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:33,826
I'd get before and after.

534
00:36:33,994 --> 00:36:36,745
Stop scratching.
You're gonna get it all infected.

535
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:39,081
I had to make a stop
at the grocery store.

536
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:42,126
It's Mrs. Birnbaum.
She's my teacher, she's on TV.

537
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,338
Here is Grayson's Market, which
was open for business at the time...

538
00:36:46,506 --> 00:36:49,925
...but fortunately, there were
no fatalities or injuries reported.

539
00:36:50,093 --> 00:36:52,261
It really is a miracle
that no one got hurt.

540
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:54,805
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

541
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,851
Did you see what happened
to our supermarket?

542
00:37:01,188 --> 00:37:03,272
She wants us to come home.

543
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,607
is this even possible?

544
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:06,942
We worked every option
through the night.

545
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:11,280
The good news, consensus is that four
of the arks will be operational in time.

546
00:37:11,448 --> 00:37:13,115
Only four? You call that good news?

547
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:15,784
We can save over 400,000 people.

548
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:18,037
To me, sir,
that's nothing short of a miracle.

549
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:21,957
But we have to initiate
the boarding process now. Thomas.

550
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,126
We don't have a choice.

551
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:26,170
You have got to convince them.

552
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,591
Listen, I'll try to keep this brief.

553
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:33,803
According to the latest information
from Yellowsto...

554
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,972
- Please continue, Adrian.
- Thank you, sir.

555
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,517
The temperature
of the subterranean crust...

556
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:43,437
...that is, the cement that holds
our land mass in place...

557
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:46,899
...is increasing at a rapid rate,
much faster than anticipated.

558
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:50,152
As a result, we've observed
extreme polar instability.

559
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,113
The magnetic fields have decreased
by more than 80 percent...

560
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:54,824
...in the last 48 hours.

561
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:58,160
How much time do we have,
Dr. Helmsley?

562
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:02,164
Two, maybe three days,
if we're lucky.

563
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:06,669
How can you speak about luck
in such a situation?

564
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:09,588
Apologies, Mr. Prime Minister. I...

565
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:12,716
I meant no disrespect.

566
00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:17,888
I'm afraid the longer we wait,
the more luck plays its part.

567
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:25,020
My friends...

568
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:28,774
...I recommend
we evacuate immediately.

569
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:34,071
If any of you have objections...

570
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,782
...please speak now.

571
00:38:37,784 --> 00:38:39,368
In the blue corner...

572
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:42,997
...38 victories, 34 knockouts...

573
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:46,041
...the fighting machine
from the Ukraine...

574
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:50,588
...the undefeated number-one ranked
heavyweight challenger:

575
00:38:50,755 --> 00:38:57,428
Mr. Zultan Balashin!

576
00:39:02,225 --> 00:39:04,810
- Yuri!
- Zultan!

577
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:07,062
I feared you would not come.

578
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,231
He needs to concentrate now,
Mr. Karpov.

579
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:12,985
You shut up when I talk to my boy,
understand?

580
00:39:13,737 --> 00:39:15,070
Yes, Mr. Karpov.

581
00:39:15,238 --> 00:39:17,823
Good. That is good.

582
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:20,242
Zultan, listen to me...

583
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,412
...we are fighters,
we never go down...

584
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:27,333
...no matter how hard they hit us.

585
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,086
Kill the bastard.

586
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:34,423
Kill the bastard, Zultan.

587
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:36,967
Ladies and gentlemen...

588
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:41,096
...let's get ready to rumble!

589
00:39:44,434 --> 00:39:46,268
Zultan!

590
00:40:13,964 --> 00:40:15,464
Yuri, where are you going?

591
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:20,094
Yuri?

592
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:27,143
One, two, three...

593
00:40:28,186 --> 00:40:31,522
Caltech believes that the half-mile
fissure running through Westwood...

594
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,774
...has released
most of the surface tension.

595
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:36,819
"Life will soon return to normal,"
Mayor Gonzales said...

596
00:40:36,987 --> 00:40:40,322
- ... at an early news conference.
- Okay, guys. Almost home.

597
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:43,492
Rise and shine.

598
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:56,130
All right, you're free.

599
00:40:57,632 --> 00:41:00,342
- Thank God.
- Mommy.

600
00:41:01,678 --> 00:41:03,512
Hi, sweetheart.

601
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:08,893
Gordon!

602
00:41:10,103 --> 00:41:12,146
Hey, buddy boy.

603
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:15,357
Good time? Yeah?

604
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:17,193
God, I missed you.

605
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
Yeah.

606
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:20,905
- Who wants pancakes? Come on.
- Me.

607
00:41:25,202 --> 00:41:28,579
- Thanks for bringing them home early.
- Yeah.

608
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:31,040
Pancakes?

609
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:34,210
Late for work.

610
00:41:45,096 --> 00:41:47,807
- Yes, hello?
- Curtis, where are you?

611
00:41:47,974 --> 00:41:51,560
- Just getting back from vacation, sir.
- Good. That is good.

612
00:41:51,728 --> 00:41:54,104
I will send the jet
to pick up Alec and Oleg.

613
00:41:54,272 --> 00:41:57,233
Yuri bear, tell him to bring
the raincoat for Caesar.

614
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,735
- It's in the Range Rover.
- Curtis.

615
00:41:59,903 --> 00:42:02,071
- Yeah?
- Get my boys as fast as you can.

616
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:04,240
I'm hurtling towards you
as we speak, sir.

617
00:42:04,407 --> 00:42:05,616
Good. That is good.

618
00:42:21,091 --> 00:42:22,424
Curtis, you're late.

619
00:42:22,592 --> 00:42:24,468
Good morning to you too.

620
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:31,767
Oh, be careful with our stuff.
Don't get your dirt on it.

621
00:42:32,102 --> 00:42:33,686
Idiot.

622
00:42:40,443 --> 00:42:42,194
Took you a while, Mr. Curtis.

623
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:47,783
What's your problem?

624
00:42:47,951 --> 00:42:49,285
Be more careful.

625
00:42:49,452 --> 00:42:50,995
He did that on purpose.

626
00:42:51,163 --> 00:42:53,455
Hey, have a safe trip,
you little bastards.

627
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,791
Now you're laughing, Curtis...

628
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:57,960
...but we have tickets
to go on a big ship.

629
00:42:58,128 --> 00:42:59,712
We will live...

630
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,006
...and you will die.

631
00:43:13,602 --> 00:43:15,478
Folks, did you hear that?

632
00:43:15,645 --> 00:43:20,065
The authorities in L.A.
say there's nothing to worry about.

633
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:22,693
I'd love to see their dumb faces...

634
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:25,321
...when Malibu and Beverly Hills...

635
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:29,116
...get sucked into the gurgling maw
of the Pacific.

636
00:43:29,284 --> 00:43:32,328
Where they gonna plug in
their electric cars then?

637
00:43:36,249 --> 00:43:38,209
- Hey. is this your plane?
- Yes.

638
00:43:38,376 --> 00:43:39,835
- Are you a pilot?
- Yeah.

639
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:41,879
I wanna rent it.
I'll give you anything.

640
00:43:42,047 --> 00:43:43,797
Here.
This is a very expensive watch.

641
00:43:43,965 --> 00:43:47,176
My editor gave it to me when
he thought I was gonna be somebody.

642
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:53,224
I confirmed with my people at Caltech
that in the last 36 hours...

643
00:43:53,683 --> 00:43:57,937
...we had basically zero earthquake
activity in Southern California...

644
00:43:58,104 --> 00:44:00,898
...which is very rare.
Unlike many of the tough characters...

645
00:44:01,066 --> 00:44:03,400
- ... I've portrayed in my film career...
- Hello?

646
00:44:04,194 --> 00:44:05,736
- Stop what you're doing.
- Jackson?

647
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:08,531
Listen to me. I've rented a plane.
Pack up the kids.

648
00:44:08,698 --> 00:44:11,367
- I'm gonna be there in five minutes.
- Plane? What?

649
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:15,037
We're gonna do our regular Saturday.
Noah has music and Lil has karate.

650
00:44:15,205 --> 00:44:16,872
Not that we'd expect him
to remember.

651
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,209
Kate, California is going down.
Pack up the kids now!

652
00:44:20,377 --> 00:44:22,044
They just got back.

653
00:44:22,212 --> 00:44:25,881
God, you sound like a crazy person.
The governorjust said we're fine now.

654
00:44:26,049 --> 00:44:28,884
The guy's an actor.
He's reading a script.

655
00:44:29,052 --> 00:44:30,803
When they tell you not to panic...

656
00:44:30,971 --> 00:44:32,638
...that's when you run!

657
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:35,683
Okay, could you call me back
when you calm down?

658
00:44:36,226 --> 00:44:38,561
Mommy, why is Daddy so crazy?

659
00:44:38,728 --> 00:44:41,230
...taking the most severe hit
in Los Angeles.

660
00:44:41,398 --> 00:44:43,774
Finish your pancakes, Al Capone.

661
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:47,820
It seems to me
that the worst is over.

662
00:44:49,865 --> 00:44:51,198
Mommy!

663
00:45:01,293 --> 00:45:03,294
Everyone hold on to each other.

664
00:45:03,461 --> 00:45:06,422
- No, Lilly!
- Hold Mommy's hand and stay close.

665
00:45:08,758 --> 00:45:09,842
Daddy!

666
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,302
Let's go! Let's go!

667
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,304
I think it's safer under here!

668
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:17,433
Get in the fucking car right now!

669
00:45:17,601 --> 00:45:19,101
Move your ass! Move!

670
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:20,561
- Come on, kids.
- Get up!

671
00:45:20,729 --> 00:45:22,438
- Move. Quick, quick!
- Move!

672
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:25,274
Go! Now!

673
00:45:26,276 --> 00:45:28,611
- Come on, let's go.
- Run! Don't look back!

674
00:45:28,778 --> 00:45:30,946
- Come on!
- Take her! Get in, honey, get in.

675
00:45:32,407 --> 00:45:33,908
My hats.

676
00:45:35,494 --> 00:45:37,161
Lilly, get in!

677
00:45:38,246 --> 00:45:39,288
Get in!

678
00:45:39,456 --> 00:45:41,707
- Buckle up!
- Lilly.

679
00:45:49,758 --> 00:45:51,133
Sorry.

680
00:46:04,481 --> 00:46:06,524
Jackson, hurry up. Look behind you.

681
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:09,902
- Holy...!
- Oh, God.

682
00:46:14,658 --> 00:46:16,408
Get out of herw!
Get out of the way!

683
00:46:16,576 --> 00:46:19,161
- Move it!
- Hold on to those eggs, dear.

684
00:46:19,329 --> 00:46:21,330
- Come on!
- Come on, you old bags!

685
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:25,167
Sidewalk, sidewalk! Tree! Tree!

686
00:46:27,337 --> 00:46:29,338
God. Carwful.

687
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:34,218
Everybody, hang on.

688
00:46:37,764 --> 00:46:38,931
Oh, my God.

689
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,558
Careful, careful.

690
00:46:45,021 --> 00:46:46,355
Yikes. That stinks.

691
00:46:52,445 --> 00:46:54,280
We gotta get to the airport.

692
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:56,740
Well, take the freeway,
it'll be half the time.

693
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,453
Yeah, right.

694
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:09,211
Jesus.

695
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:13,215
We gotta get to the other side
of the freeway.

696
00:47:14,217 --> 00:47:15,843
Daddy!

697
00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:30,649
- Dad, look!
- No. We're not gonna make it! Careful!

698
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:40,910
- No, Daddy!
- Dad, look. Dad, look.

699
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:43,829
No, no, no!

700
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,261
It's been upgraded to a 10.9
by the guys at Harvard.

701
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:00,930
What does Caltech have to say?

702
00:48:01,097 --> 00:48:05,267
The whole city of Pasadena
was wiped out just a few minutes ago.

703
00:48:05,435 --> 00:48:08,395
This is coming in from Coachella
Valley out near Joshua Tree.

704
00:48:08,563 --> 00:48:10,689
That canyon?
That wasn't there this morning.

705
00:48:10,857 --> 00:48:14,860
And 400 miles further north,
Point Reyes, same thing.

706
00:48:16,446 --> 00:48:18,405
The San Andreas Fault is shifting.

707
00:48:18,573 --> 00:48:21,283
Yes. And all major sister faults
in the Bay Area.

708
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:25,287
The whole Pacific plate
is destabilizing.

709
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:33,337
Hold my hand. Stay close to me.

710
00:48:34,548 --> 00:48:35,965
Come on!

711
00:48:36,132 --> 00:48:38,008
- Who's that?
- Our pilot!

712
00:48:38,176 --> 00:48:40,803
Oh, jeez. It's our pilot.

713
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:42,888
Gordon. Gordon, you can fly.

714
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:46,517
No, no, I've only had a couple of
lessons in a single-engine plane only.

715
00:48:46,685 --> 00:48:48,310
- You're the guy.
- I am not the guy.

716
00:48:48,478 --> 00:48:52,356
- Trust me, you're the guy.
- I'm not being modest about this.

717
00:48:52,524 --> 00:48:54,817
Come on, kids.
Gordon's gonna get us out of here.

718
00:48:54,985 --> 00:48:57,153
That plane has multiple engines.

719
00:48:58,363 --> 00:49:00,156
Jackson!

720
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:17,006
- T's and P's, T's and P's.
- T and P?

721
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:18,841
- Temperatures and pressures.
- Go!

722
00:49:19,009 --> 00:49:21,594
- I've gotta do my preflight check.
- Let him concentrate.

723
00:49:21,761 --> 00:49:23,095
He has no experience.

724
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:24,680
Thank you.

725
00:49:26,183 --> 00:49:27,683
- Gordon, go.
- Come on.

726
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:29,894
- Gordon!
- Go, go, go!

727
00:49:32,355 --> 00:49:34,773
- We're not there yet.
- Gordon, take off.

728
00:49:35,859 --> 00:49:38,068
- Punch it, punch it!
- I have to get to 85 knots.

729
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:40,863
- Eighty's good.
- Oh, screw it. Here we go.

730
00:49:45,744 --> 00:49:47,745
Okay. Okay, we're up.

731
00:49:56,922 --> 00:49:58,631
Higher, higher!

732
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,253
Oh, my God.

733
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:06,448
Lilly, go sit with your brother.

734
00:51:11,288 --> 00:51:14,123
I don't understand. How did you know
this was gonna happen?

735
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:16,834
It is not just California.

736
00:51:17,002 --> 00:51:19,712
It's the whole goddamn world
that's going to shit.

737
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,006
I met this guy in Yellowstone,
this crazy guy.

738
00:51:22,174 --> 00:51:24,842
He's been right about everything
that's happened so far.

739
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,303
And he said the government
is building spaceships.

740
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:29,638
- I don't know what, but something.
- Ships?

741
00:51:29,806 --> 00:51:31,640
Yeah, places where we can be safe.

742
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,643
He knows where they are.
He's got a map.

743
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:36,145
Jackson.

744
00:51:36,313 --> 00:51:38,439
Kate, you gotta just trust me on this,
okay?

745
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:41,150
Guys, look.

746
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:07,009
There's a twist and a turn
To each lesson you learn

747
00:52:07,177 --> 00:52:10,513
First you're up, then you're bust
Livin' life on a crust

748
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,849
But it ain't the end of the world, buddy

749
00:52:14,017 --> 00:52:16,852
It's only the end of this song

750
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,439
It's been a gas, been a flip
Been a hell of a trip

751
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:25,528
But it ain't the end of the world

752
00:52:26,738 --> 00:52:28,197
Oh, yeah.

753
00:52:28,365 --> 00:52:29,448
Thank you.

754
00:52:29,616 --> 00:52:30,866
You got fans, Tony.

755
00:52:33,036 --> 00:52:35,621
There's a call for you.
You want me to take a message?

756
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:37,832
No, that's all right, Kevin. I got it.

757
00:52:43,171 --> 00:52:45,214
- Hello.
- Dad?

758
00:52:45,382 --> 00:52:46,715
Adrian.

759
00:52:46,883 --> 00:52:50,469
Remember when I told you
about that dam in China?

760
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:51,929
Yeah.

761
00:52:52,097 --> 00:52:53,889
It's happening, Dad.

762
00:53:02,732 --> 00:53:06,944
They'd probably shoot me
if they knew that I told you.

763
00:53:08,029 --> 00:53:11,240
Nobody's gonna shoot you, son.
They need you.

764
00:53:11,408 --> 00:53:15,035
The president has ordered us
to clear out the White House.

765
00:53:15,203 --> 00:53:17,746
About time somebody cleaned up
that mess.

766
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:22,334
Where are you, Dad?

767
00:53:22,878 --> 00:53:26,046
What exactly is the course
of the Genesis right now?

768
00:53:26,214 --> 00:53:28,591
It's all good, Adrian.

769
00:53:28,758 --> 00:53:31,760
Don't you be worrying
about your old man now.

770
00:53:31,928 --> 00:53:34,930
You got more important things
to do now.

771
00:53:37,309 --> 00:53:38,934
You know...

772
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:41,770
...your mom and I, we...

773
00:53:42,272 --> 00:53:45,149
We had one hell of a great life, son.

774
00:53:46,943 --> 00:53:50,404
And the best part about that...

775
00:53:51,448 --> 00:53:54,283
...is we had
one hell of a great kid too.

776
00:53:57,454 --> 00:53:58,954
Now, you lookie here.

777
00:53:59,956 --> 00:54:00,998
The Genesis...

778
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:03,626
...it's a pretty big ship, son.

779
00:54:04,127 --> 00:54:08,297
So don't you write your old man off
just yet.

780
00:54:08,465 --> 00:54:09,465
Besides...

781
00:54:11,259 --> 00:54:14,220
...you know I couldn't leave
Tony alone.

782
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:18,891
You know that old fool
can't keep decent time by himself.

783
00:54:20,644 --> 00:54:22,978
I love you, Dad.

784
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:30,444
I love you too, son.

785
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:32,738
God knows I do.

786
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:48,087
Kevin, I want a double.

787
00:54:49,673 --> 00:54:52,466
- Harry.
- I need a double right now.

788
00:54:56,596 --> 00:54:58,180
Thank you, son.

789
00:55:01,351 --> 00:55:05,729
After 25 years on the wagon,
are you out of your mind?

790
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:23,205
- What are you doing?
- Gotta go.

791
00:55:23,373 --> 00:55:26,375
- That's against regulation.
- Careful, careful.

792
00:55:30,714 --> 00:55:32,214
- Anything?
- Yeah, there's fuel.

793
00:55:32,382 --> 00:55:34,133
Fill it up. I'm gonna find Charlie.

794
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:35,968
Daddy, wait. I wanna come with you.

795
00:55:36,136 --> 00:55:39,054
- No, no. Lil. Lil, no!
- It's all right. Just fill it up.

796
00:55:39,222 --> 00:55:41,223
- We'll be back.
- Jackson, hurry, please.

797
00:55:41,725 --> 00:55:44,727
I'm standing here
at the highest point...

798
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:49,857
...of what is the rim of the world's
largest super-volcano...

799
00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:55,946
- ... Mount Bighorn, elevation 2779 feet.
- Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

800
00:55:56,907 --> 00:56:01,327
I can only hope that all of you
have made your peace with God...

801
00:56:01,495 --> 00:56:03,829
- He's gotta be around somewhere.
- Let's go back.

802
00:56:03,997 --> 00:56:06,665
No, no, no. We gotta find Charlie
because he's got a map.

803
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:09,126
It's like a secret map,
like in the Pirate movies.

804
00:56:09,294 --> 00:56:11,086
- We gotta work as a team, okay?
- Okay.

805
00:56:11,254 --> 00:56:12,922
Okay, come on.

806
00:56:13,089 --> 00:56:15,925
Call Mommy and tell her
we're gonna be 5 minutes late.

807
00:56:20,764 --> 00:56:22,765
- Hello?
- I need to talk to Mommy.

808
00:56:22,933 --> 00:56:25,100
- It's Lilly.
- Sweetheart, where are you?

809
00:56:25,268 --> 00:56:27,812
- Hi, Mommy.
- Let me speak to Daddy, sweetie.

810
00:56:27,979 --> 00:56:31,023
He can't talk right now.
He's driving really, really bad.

811
00:56:33,026 --> 00:56:35,653
Any minute now,
the fireworks are gonna start.

812
00:56:35,821 --> 00:56:37,613
Who is that?
Who's speaking in the car?

813
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:40,825
He's not in the car. He's on
a mountain waiting for fireworks.

814
00:56:40,992 --> 00:56:44,119
- Fireworks? What fireworks?
- Daddy. Daddy, over there.

815
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,831
...to send all of Yellowstone
into outer space?

816
00:56:46,998 --> 00:56:48,290
Good job, Lilly. Good job.

817
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,961
Let me talk to Mom.

818
00:56:52,128 --> 00:56:55,381
- Kate, we got him.
- Jackson, bring back my child now.

819
00:56:58,802 --> 00:57:01,804
Okay. You stay here
and guard the ship...

820
00:57:01,972 --> 00:57:04,682
- ... and I'm gonna go talk to the pirate.
- Okay.

821
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:07,518
...your race, your country, your god.

822
00:57:07,686 --> 00:57:12,398
Whether you're a Christian or
a Buddhist or Muslim or Rastafarian...

823
00:57:12,566 --> 00:57:15,818
- ... by tomorrow we will all be one!
- Charlie.

824
00:57:15,986 --> 00:57:17,862
- Jackson. What are you doing here?
- Yeah.

825
00:57:18,029 --> 00:57:20,865
- I thought you were toast.
- No. Where are the spaceships?

826
00:57:21,032 --> 00:57:23,159
There's no way
you can make it there.

827
00:57:23,326 --> 00:57:27,371
We have a plane. You could come
with us, but we gotta leave right now.

828
00:57:35,213 --> 00:57:37,840
Fly, birdies.

829
00:57:38,008 --> 00:57:39,842
Fly!

830
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:41,594
is this your kid?

831
00:57:42,512 --> 00:57:43,762
Where's the goddamn map?

832
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,848
- We're going live.
- Where is it?

833
00:57:46,016 --> 00:57:48,767
Charlie. Focus. Where's the map?
Where?

834
00:57:48,935 --> 00:57:50,019
It's in the camper.

835
00:57:50,187 --> 00:57:51,228
Where in the camper?

836
00:57:51,396 --> 00:57:54,732
In the map section
on the conspiracy shelf.

837
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,817
Dewey decimal system.

838
00:57:56,985 --> 00:57:59,403
Between Roswell...

839
00:57:59,571 --> 00:58:02,698
...and Marilyn Monroe.

840
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:13,083
It's starting.

841
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:23,552
You sure you don't wanna come with,
man?

842
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,181
It's so beautiful. I'm gonna stay.

843
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:29,683
Good luck.

844
00:58:32,896 --> 00:58:38,400
This marks the last day
of the United States of America.

845
00:58:39,736 --> 00:58:43,072
And, by tomorrow, all of mankind.

846
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,741
And we will be visible
from the Milky Way...

847
00:58:45,909 --> 00:58:48,619
...as a tiny little puff of smoke.

848
00:58:49,246 --> 00:58:53,791
I'm watching the earth crumble
before my eyes.

849
00:58:54,751 --> 00:59:00,339
The giant ash cloud
created by this super-volcano...

850
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:02,591
...will first envelop Vegas...

851
00:59:03,093 --> 00:59:04,593
...and then St. Louis...

852
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:07,263
...and then Chicago...

853
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:09,473
...and then, at long last...

854
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:14,103
...Washington, D.C.
will have its lights go out!

855
00:59:14,271 --> 00:59:17,273
- That guy's crazy, right, Daddy?
- I don't think so.

856
00:59:20,152 --> 00:59:21,610
This is ridiculous.

857
00:59:21,778 --> 00:59:24,363
Been over half an hour.
I tell you, the guy's a nut job.

858
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:26,115
Stop it, Gordon.

859
00:59:26,283 --> 00:59:28,200
Noah, hand me the phone again.

860
00:59:50,307 --> 00:59:52,349
Daddy, what was that?

861
00:59:53,351 --> 00:59:55,811
Nothing. Nothing.

862
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:59,148
I have goose bumps, people.

863
01:00:21,338 --> 01:00:24,215
I wish you could see
what I'm seeing, people.

864
01:00:24,382 --> 01:00:26,926
I wish you could be here with me!

865
01:00:27,636 --> 01:00:30,012
Oh, baby.

866
01:00:31,014 --> 01:00:33,015
Bring it on!

867
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:34,850
Always remember, folks...

868
01:00:35,685 --> 01:00:38,896
...you heard it first from Charlie!

869
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,205
Daddy, it's following us.

870
01:00:56,373 --> 01:00:57,873
Don't look! Get on the ground.

871
01:00:58,041 --> 01:01:00,209
Get on the ground and hold on.
Don't look back.

872
01:01:00,377 --> 01:01:03,420
Don't look back. Just look at me.
Look at me. Do I look scared?

873
01:01:08,635 --> 01:01:10,761
Now, hold on, baby. Hold on tight.

874
01:01:18,103 --> 01:01:19,562
Daddy, we're on fire.

875
01:01:28,238 --> 01:01:30,072
There it is! There they are.

876
01:01:35,495 --> 01:01:36,787
It's them.

877
01:01:36,955 --> 01:01:38,998
It's them. It's them.

878
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:41,500
Mommy!

879
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:46,589
Jeez.

880
01:01:53,263 --> 01:01:55,598
- No, Daddy.
- Hang on, baby. Hang on!

881
01:01:58,643 --> 01:01:59,810
No, Daddy!

882
01:02:08,945 --> 01:02:10,279
Oh, my Go...

883
01:02:10,614 --> 01:02:13,157
- Mommy.
- Take her, take her. I'll be right back.

884
01:02:19,789 --> 01:02:22,833
- Come here, Lil. Grab my hand.
- Come on, Lil. Lilly, you okay?

885
01:02:23,001 --> 01:02:25,336
Aliens, Roswell
and Marilyn Monroe...

886
01:02:25,504 --> 01:02:27,046
Maps! Maps!

887
01:02:27,506 --> 01:02:30,382
- Everybody on? Are we ready?
- Jackson!

888
01:02:33,512 --> 01:02:36,472
- Kate, where is he? What's he doing?
- I don't know.

889
01:02:39,643 --> 01:02:41,227
No!

890
01:02:49,569 --> 01:02:51,403
- Daddy!
- No!

891
01:02:54,658 --> 01:02:57,827
- Oh, my God.
- Kate, we have to go.

892
01:02:57,994 --> 01:02:59,578
No. We're not going anywhere.

893
01:02:59,746 --> 01:03:03,624
- Kids, buckle up, we're leaving.
- This is my dad. We're gonna wait.

894
01:03:08,505 --> 01:03:10,256
No!

895
01:03:10,423 --> 01:03:12,007
Daddy!

896
01:03:15,512 --> 01:03:18,430
Wait!
Wait, Gordon, I see something.

897
01:03:18,598 --> 01:03:20,182
Dad!

898
01:03:24,729 --> 01:03:25,938
It's Daddy!

899
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,694
Slow down!

900
01:03:31,862 --> 01:03:32,862
Jackson, run!

901
01:03:33,864 --> 01:03:36,365
Jackson, take my hand. Jackson.

902
01:03:36,533 --> 01:03:38,742
- Dad, hurry!
- Run!

903
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:42,705
We're running out of runway.
For God's sakes, Kate, pull him up.

904
01:03:42,873 --> 01:03:46,417
- Jackson, reach for my hand.
- Dad, you can make it, come on.

905
01:03:46,585 --> 01:03:48,252
Daddy!

906
01:03:52,382 --> 01:03:54,383
All right, buckle in. Here we go!

907
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:57,136
Come on, faster. Faster.

908
01:04:17,073 --> 01:04:18,616
Hang on.

909
01:04:20,952 --> 01:04:22,786
- Go faster.
- I'm trying.

910
01:04:39,596 --> 01:04:41,597
Okay. We're good!

911
01:04:41,765 --> 01:04:44,600
- We're good.
- We're okay.

912
01:04:47,979 --> 01:04:51,106
So now that you got your map,
where are we going?

913
01:05:02,452 --> 01:05:04,537
We're gonna need a bigger plane.

914
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,463
No, you just said that, Mom.
Yeah, you just said that.

915
01:05:14,631 --> 01:05:16,632
You don't remember
that you just said that?

916
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,010
That's okay. That's okay.

917
01:05:20,178 --> 01:05:24,306
Listen, Ma, I am going to call you
next week, same time.

918
01:05:24,808 --> 01:05:26,058
Okay?

919
01:05:26,226 --> 01:05:28,477
You take care now.
Take care of yourself.

920
01:05:31,982 --> 01:05:33,566
Sir?

921
01:05:34,401 --> 01:05:36,485
I think you need to see this.

922
01:05:41,658 --> 01:05:44,201
I thought for sure
they'd give you an extra ticket, sir.

923
01:05:44,369 --> 01:05:45,703
They did.

924
01:05:45,871 --> 01:05:48,539
But my mother is almost 89...

925
01:05:48,707 --> 01:05:51,667
...she's in a wheelchair,
and she's easily confused.

926
01:05:51,835 --> 01:05:54,628
And I am confident that she
would want to meet her maker...

927
01:05:54,796 --> 01:05:56,547
...on her own terms, okay?

928
01:05:56,715 --> 01:05:58,507
Yes, sir. Who are you bringing?

929
01:05:58,675 --> 01:06:02,219
Nobody. Who, my ex-wife?
Last thing she said to me...

930
01:06:02,387 --> 01:06:04,680
...she never wanted to see me again.
So be it.

931
01:06:04,848 --> 01:06:06,849
We need to bring people
who can contribute.

932
01:06:07,017 --> 01:06:09,185
The South American continent
has been ravaged...

933
01:06:09,352 --> 01:06:11,061
...by a series of major earthquakes.

934
01:06:11,229 --> 01:06:14,315
The death toll is expected
to be well over 2 million people.

935
01:06:14,483 --> 01:06:17,735
The devastation in Rio de Janeiro
is beyond imagination.

936
01:06:17,903 --> 01:06:20,905
Two 8.5 tremors have left
the people in the streets...

937
01:06:21,072 --> 01:06:23,699
...desperately fighting
for the last remaining resources.

938
01:06:23,867 --> 01:06:28,162
In the last hour, we received this video from Globo News, Brazil.

939
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:37,755
Fear and chaos have spread
throughout the globe, as in London...

940
01:06:37,923 --> 01:06:40,758
...where the 30th Olympic Games
have just been suspended.

941
01:06:40,926 --> 01:06:43,844
Hundreds of thousands are marching
towards 10 Downing Street...

942
01:06:44,012 --> 01:06:46,806
...demanding a lift
of the information blackout.

943
01:06:46,973 --> 01:06:49,558
We've had thousands of calls.
We had to shut it down.

944
01:06:49,726 --> 01:06:52,311
We're receiving reports
from all across the globe.

945
01:06:52,479 --> 01:06:54,730
Millions upon millions
of distraught masses...

946
01:06:54,898 --> 01:06:58,108
...are gathering in public places,
converging in desperate prayer.

947
01:06:58,276 --> 01:07:00,361
Preachers of many
religious denominations...

948
01:07:00,529 --> 01:07:02,446
...have taken their message
of the end...

949
01:07:02,614 --> 01:07:04,240
...to the strwets all over the U.S.

950
01:07:04,407 --> 01:07:06,742
Repent. There is still time.

951
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:10,788
Kind of galling when you realize that
nutbags with their signs had it right.

952
01:07:10,956 --> 01:07:13,082
All these people out there, sir...

953
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,084
...shouldn't we be
issuing warnings now?

954
01:07:15,252 --> 01:07:18,087
Only when the boarding process
is complete. That's the plan.

955
01:07:18,255 --> 01:07:21,257
- British Columbia, 2010, remember?
- Sir.

956
01:07:21,424 --> 01:07:23,634
Sir, those plans were drawn up
two years ago.

957
01:07:23,802 --> 01:07:27,263
Okay. Everybody out.
Go on, get out.

958
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:28,472
Mary, get the door.

959
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:31,475
Wasn't it decided
that people have the right...

960
01:07:31,643 --> 01:07:33,769
...to fight for their lives
best way they can?

961
01:07:33,937 --> 01:07:36,272
After we get everyone on board,
Adrian.

962
01:07:36,439 --> 01:07:37,481
I think that's wrong.

963
01:07:37,649 --> 01:07:41,402
Wha...? Just wanna tell everyone
they're doomed?

964
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:42,695
There'd be anarchy.

965
01:07:43,446 --> 01:07:46,115
- You wanna jeopardize the president?
- Come on.

966
01:07:46,283 --> 01:07:51,036
Our mission is to assurw
the continuity of our species.

967
01:07:51,788 --> 01:07:55,166
My question: Can I count on you?

968
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:56,709
Can I?

969
01:07:57,377 --> 01:07:58,586
What?

970
01:07:58,753 --> 01:08:00,379
The Yellowstone caldera
has erupted.

971
01:08:00,547 --> 01:08:04,175
The ash cloud will reach Washington
in roughly seven hours.

972
01:08:05,135 --> 01:08:07,470
We've got to get
the government airborne.

973
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,513
Where's the president, Sally?

974
01:08:09,681 --> 01:08:12,641
Said he wanted some time alone.
I think he's over at the chapel.

975
01:08:12,809 --> 01:08:15,186
- He's gotta go to church now?
- He's praying, sir.

976
01:08:15,353 --> 01:08:18,063
Which, under the circumstances,
is not such a bad idea.

977
01:08:21,776 --> 01:08:23,319
Mr. President.

978
01:08:23,487 --> 01:08:26,405
I need to get you on Air Force One
immediately.

979
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,533
Give me a moment with Adrian.

980
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:31,827
No disrespect,
but we simply do not have time.

981
01:08:31,995 --> 01:08:33,412
Make time.

982
01:08:46,009 --> 01:08:48,969
Did you ever meet my wife,
Dorothy?

983
01:08:49,137 --> 01:08:52,348
No, sir. I didn't have that honor.

984
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:56,227
She was in and out of it
towards the end.

985
01:08:57,062 --> 01:09:01,065
The night before she passed on,
she took my hand and she told me:

986
01:09:01,233 --> 01:09:04,902
"I think you should have a lottery.

987
01:09:05,904 --> 01:09:09,532
Everyone should
have a chance to go. "

988
01:09:12,202 --> 01:09:14,036
Maybe that's what
we should have done.

989
01:09:17,707 --> 01:09:22,169
I'll be the last president
of the United States of America.

990
01:09:22,337 --> 01:09:24,380
Do you know how that feels, son?

991
01:09:25,549 --> 01:09:28,425
No one could have
saved the country, sir.

992
01:09:29,761 --> 01:09:31,220
And I think...

993
01:09:31,888 --> 01:09:34,390
I think people have a right to know.

994
01:09:35,225 --> 01:09:37,893
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.

995
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:41,105
Go on now.

996
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:44,733
Not without you, sir.

997
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:47,903
You get on that plane, son.

998
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:52,449
It's a brave new world
you're heading to.

999
01:09:52,617 --> 01:09:57,830
And a young scientist
is gonna be worth 20 old politicians.

1000
01:10:16,308 --> 01:10:18,601
We should go to my parents' house
in the Rockies.

1001
01:10:18,768 --> 01:10:22,938
This isn't one of your crazy stories.
How are we gonna make it to China?

1002
01:10:23,106 --> 01:10:26,442
Gordon, without Jackson, we wouldn't
have made it out of California.

1003
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:28,110
Noah, please.

1004
01:10:35,619 --> 01:10:38,120
You, be careful
with the landing gear.

1005
01:10:38,288 --> 01:10:40,623
Easy, gringo. I know what I doing.

1006
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:43,292
Attention. The National Guard
has informed us...

1007
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,419
...that an extremely hazardous
ash cloud...

1008
01:10:45,587 --> 01:10:47,004
...is headed for Las Vegas.

1009
01:10:47,172 --> 01:10:48,464
Hey, where are you going?

1010
01:10:48,632 --> 01:10:51,133
Everyone move indoors
immediately.

1011
01:10:51,301 --> 01:10:53,511
- Sir, you can't stay here.
- I have plane here.

1012
01:10:53,678 --> 01:10:54,887
It's not safe. Move it!

1013
01:10:55,847 --> 01:10:56,889
Move it!

1014
01:11:06,024 --> 01:11:08,567
So you have
positive confirmation on this?

1015
01:11:10,028 --> 01:11:11,821
Thank you, I understand.

1016
01:11:22,582 --> 01:11:24,333
President's not coming.

1017
01:11:29,381 --> 01:11:30,840
So...

1018
01:11:31,007 --> 01:11:35,511
...the captain doesn't want to abandon
his sinking ship.

1019
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,096
That's his choice.

1020
01:11:37,264 --> 01:11:39,348
And a noble one.

1021
01:11:39,516 --> 01:11:42,893
I have also just learned
that the vice-president's chopper...

1022
01:11:43,061 --> 01:11:45,604
...went down in the ash cloud
outside of Pittsburgh.

1023
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:50,442
Fortunately,
we have protocols to follow.

1024
01:11:50,861 --> 01:11:52,528
What about
the Speaker of the House?

1025
01:11:52,696 --> 01:11:56,031
- I have no idea. Where is he?
- He's the commander in chief now, sir.

1026
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:59,535
This is one flight
he shouldn't have been late for.

1027
01:11:59,703 --> 01:12:02,788
- Tell the captain we're taking off.
- You don't have the authority.

1028
01:12:02,956 --> 01:12:05,040
Who's got authority?
You've got the authority?

1029
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:07,084
You couldn't
even keep your mouth shut.

1030
01:12:07,252 --> 01:12:09,628
You betrayed top-secret information
last year.

1031
01:12:09,796 --> 01:12:12,256
- What are you talking about?
- You told your father...

1032
01:12:12,424 --> 01:12:13,757
...put this plan in jeopardy.

1033
01:12:13,925 --> 01:12:16,802
Good thing for you the old man
could keep his mouth shut.

1034
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,971
Oh, come on.
Don't look so shocked.

1035
01:12:19,139 --> 01:12:22,224
We had to monitor everybody.
How do you think we kept it a secret?

1036
01:12:22,392 --> 01:12:24,727
We just killed anybody
who tried to talk?

1037
01:12:24,895 --> 01:12:26,228
Anybody who tried to talk...

1038
01:12:26,396 --> 01:12:29,190
...was not just an enemy of the state,
they're an enemy of humanity.

1039
01:12:29,357 --> 01:12:31,609
The director of the Louvre,
an enemy of humanity?

1040
01:12:31,776 --> 01:12:33,777
After he called a press conference
he was!

1041
01:12:34,863 --> 01:12:36,822
Jesus. What did you think?

1042
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:41,076
We're all just gonna get on board,
hold hands and sing "Kumbaya"?

1043
01:12:41,661 --> 01:12:43,579
Sit down and buckle up.

1044
01:12:52,964 --> 01:12:55,883
Oh, excuse me.
is my father in the command center?

1045
01:12:56,051 --> 01:12:58,469
President's on the line, Dr. Wilson.

1046
01:12:59,763 --> 01:13:01,180
Thank you.

1047
01:13:07,813 --> 01:13:08,979
Where are you?

1048
01:13:09,147 --> 01:13:13,108
You never would have gotten
on that plane if I told you.

1049
01:13:15,278 --> 01:13:16,821
But you said that you'd be...

1050
01:13:16,988 --> 01:13:18,697
Darling, listen to me.

1051
01:13:18,865 --> 01:13:21,534
Do you understand
how much strength it gives me...

1052
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:23,869
...knowing that you'll survive?

1053
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,790
The only thing left to do now...

1054
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:31,252
...is tell the truth to people.

1055
01:13:32,087 --> 01:13:34,380
At least if they know...

1056
01:13:36,675 --> 01:13:40,136
...families can say goodbye
to each other.

1057
01:13:40,804 --> 01:13:44,181
A mother can comfort her children.

1058
01:13:46,101 --> 01:13:47,977
And a father...

1059
01:13:50,147 --> 01:13:53,065
...can ask his daughter
for forgiveness.

1060
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:04,660
Whenever you're ready,
Mr. President.

1061
01:14:12,919 --> 01:14:15,129
My fellow Americans...

1062
01:14:15,839 --> 01:14:19,175
...this will be the last time
I address you.

1063
01:14:19,926 --> 01:14:21,218
As you know...

1064
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:25,222
...catastrophe has struck
our nation...

1065
01:14:26,391 --> 01:14:28,517
...has struck the world.

1066
01:14:28,685 --> 01:14:30,519
I wish I could tell you...

1067
01:14:31,062 --> 01:14:34,190
...we could prevent
the coming destruction.

1068
01:14:34,649 --> 01:14:36,275
We cannot.

1069
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,403
Today, none of us are strangers.

1070
01:14:40,864 --> 01:14:42,031
Today...

1071
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:47,411
...we are one family
stepping into the darkness together.

1072
01:14:47,579 --> 01:14:50,789
We are a nation of many religions...

1073
01:14:50,957 --> 01:14:57,129
...but I believe these words
reflect the spirit of all of our faiths:

1074
01:14:57,964 --> 01:15:01,091
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall...

1075
01:15:02,385 --> 01:15:05,721
People! Keep away
from the doors and windows.

1076
01:15:05,889 --> 01:15:08,057
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

1077
01:15:08,225 --> 01:15:09,433
Dr. Silberman.

1078
01:15:10,644 --> 01:15:12,645
- Tamara.
- What are you doing here?

1079
01:15:12,813 --> 01:15:15,481
- Excuse me.
- She's a patient, honey.

1080
01:15:15,649 --> 01:15:18,442
Excuse me,
I have a private plane out there.

1081
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:19,902
- Karpov!
- We need help.

1082
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:21,487
- Yuri!
- Takeoffs are canceled.

1083
01:15:21,655 --> 01:15:24,281
- Curtis, you're...
- You knew. This whole time you knew.

1084
01:15:24,449 --> 01:15:27,326
So you've got a way out of here, right?
You got a plane?

1085
01:15:27,494 --> 01:15:29,620
My family, take us with.
Please. Please.

1086
01:15:29,788 --> 01:15:31,580
Boss. Boss.

1087
01:15:31,748 --> 01:15:33,707
I found us a plane, an Antonov.

1088
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:36,585
They were about to take off,
but the tower didn't let them.

1089
01:15:36,753 --> 01:15:39,004
But can you still fly that thing?

1090
01:15:39,172 --> 01:15:41,966
Sure, boss. But I need copilot.

1091
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,094
Gordon's a pilot.

1092
01:15:46,054 --> 01:15:47,680
No, I'm not. I'm not.

1093
01:15:47,848 --> 01:15:49,849
Yes, he is. Great pilot. Let's go.

1094
01:15:51,268 --> 01:15:52,434
Good. Let's go!

1095
01:15:52,602 --> 01:15:55,354
Honey, this is...
Jackson, stop saying I'm a pilot.

1096
01:15:55,522 --> 01:15:57,857
Hey! Hey, stop!

1097
01:15:58,066 --> 01:16:00,442
You can't go out there. Come back!

1098
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:07,283
Move back, people.

1099
01:16:07,492 --> 01:16:08,951
Get away from the glass!

1100
01:16:13,623 --> 01:16:15,624
Wow, that's a big plane.

1101
01:16:16,793 --> 01:16:18,627
It's Russian.

1102
01:16:19,296 --> 01:16:21,130
- Let's move, everybody. Come on.
- Run!

1103
01:16:21,298 --> 01:16:23,632
- Yeah, let's go, let's go.
- Boys, come on.

1104
01:16:26,803 --> 01:16:28,721
- Gordon, where are you?
- Where did you go?

1105
01:16:28,889 --> 01:16:31,849
I'm up here in the cockpit.
Hurry up.

1106
01:16:32,601 --> 01:16:34,643
Oh, my God. Not again.

1107
01:16:42,652 --> 01:16:44,111
Whoa, look at these.

1108
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:46,655
Las Vegas Auto Show.

1109
01:16:46,823 --> 01:16:48,991
We had VIP tickets for that.

1110
01:16:49,409 --> 01:16:50,868
That's fantastic. Let's go.

1111
01:16:51,036 --> 01:16:53,954
Check the main bus for hydraulics,
I'll balance the tanks.

1112
01:16:54,122 --> 01:16:55,456
What?

1113
01:16:57,042 --> 01:16:59,710
Okay, okay, okay. I'm trying, okay?
I'm trying.

1114
01:17:01,171 --> 01:17:02,922
Tower to Antonov.
What are you doing?

1115
01:17:03,089 --> 01:17:04,840
Shut down immediately.

1116
01:17:12,182 --> 01:17:13,516
Caesar.

1117
01:17:13,683 --> 01:17:16,936
Okay, when I say go,
you push all this down at once, okay?

1118
01:17:17,103 --> 01:17:18,187
- Okay.
- Go!

1119
01:17:19,022 --> 01:17:21,690
Antonov, abort takeoff.
You do not have clearance.

1120
01:17:21,858 --> 01:17:24,693
You must abort.
I repeat, you must abort.

1121
01:17:24,861 --> 01:17:25,903
No!

1122
01:17:31,701 --> 01:17:34,870
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, but it's not good.

1123
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:39,083
- Push.
- Pushing.

1124
01:17:39,251 --> 01:17:40,793
Come on!

1125
01:17:44,381 --> 01:17:46,632
We're going down!
We're going down!

1126
01:17:53,181 --> 01:17:55,558
Where are the flaps?
The flaps are not down.

1127
01:17:55,725 --> 01:17:57,685
It must be the pumps. Take over.

1128
01:17:57,853 --> 01:18:00,437
Take over?
What do you mean, take over?

1129
01:18:02,566 --> 01:18:03,899
- Sasha!
- Relax!

1130
01:18:04,067 --> 01:18:05,109
Sit down!

1131
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:11,949
God. God. Jesus.

1132
01:18:14,828 --> 01:18:16,412
- Oh, God.
- Okay, I think I got it.

1133
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,331
- Sasha, now!
- Okay, okay. Take a deep breath.

1134
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,750
Pull!

1135
01:18:23,336 --> 01:18:26,422
Come on, baby.
Lift your big ass for Sasha!

1136
01:18:31,261 --> 01:18:32,928
- Pull! Pull!
- Come on.

1137
01:18:45,233 --> 01:18:46,275
Mommy.

1138
01:18:48,445 --> 01:18:50,279
Was that the Eiffel Tower?

1139
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:52,448
I think so.

1140
01:19:00,248 --> 01:19:01,707
Ladies and gentlemen...

1141
01:19:02,292 --> 01:19:04,877
...we are on our way to China.

1142
01:19:06,505 --> 01:19:09,840
Good. That is good, huh?

1143
01:19:20,227 --> 01:19:24,146
Do not believe in something simply
because you have heard it, Nima.

1144
01:19:25,232 --> 01:19:28,025
But, great Lama,
Tenzin is my brother.

1145
01:19:29,069 --> 01:19:32,029
He works inside the big tunnel,
where the ships are built.

1146
01:19:35,116 --> 01:19:39,578
But what is there in your wisdom,
great Lama, if Tenzin is right?

1147
01:19:40,205 --> 01:19:42,623
What if our world
is indeed coming to an end?

1148
01:19:52,759 --> 01:19:56,011
it is full, great Rinpoche.

1149
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:02,852
Like this cup...

1150
01:20:03,019 --> 01:20:07,523
...you are full of opinions
and speculations.

1151
01:20:09,526 --> 01:20:11,193
To see the light of wisdom...

1152
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:14,405
...you first must empty your cup.

1153
01:20:32,048 --> 01:20:33,549
Be careful with the clutch.

1154
01:20:34,384 --> 01:20:36,385
it tends to slip.

1155
01:20:54,696 --> 01:20:57,740
- Grandma.
- Grandpa, Nima is here!

1156
01:20:58,325 --> 01:21:00,075
Grandma,
I got a message from Tenzin.

1157
01:21:00,452 --> 01:21:03,245
He wants us to meet him
in Cho Ming at the west gate.

1158
01:21:03,997 --> 01:21:06,916
He says he can get us on the ships
he's working on.

1159
01:21:07,918 --> 01:21:11,170
What are you talking about?
Tenzin works on the dam.

1160
01:21:14,508 --> 01:21:16,091
Grandma...

1161
01:21:16,676 --> 01:21:20,054
...the dam is a ship!
The government lied to us.

1162
01:21:20,388 --> 01:21:22,473
There will be a big flood!

1163
01:21:23,141 --> 01:21:24,600
We must pack up right away.

1164
01:21:24,893 --> 01:21:27,520
Nima, he gave you the truck?

1165
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:31,440
We took a trip
on the Laem Song ferry once.

1166
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,652
Grandpa threw up the whole way.

1167
01:21:36,154 --> 01:21:37,446
Let's eat first.

1168
01:21:43,537 --> 01:21:44,912
Hey, look. The new Bentley.

1169
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,081
Our father had one on order.

1170
01:21:47,249 --> 01:21:49,333
We were supposed
to get it next year.

1171
01:21:49,501 --> 01:21:52,002
But then he canceled it
because of the ships.

1172
01:21:53,004 --> 01:21:55,756
How many cars
does your family have?

1173
01:21:56,341 --> 01:21:57,925
My mom's boyfriend
has a Porsche.

1174
01:21:59,469 --> 01:22:01,262
Our parents are divorced too.

1175
01:22:01,429 --> 01:22:03,806
Yeah, but there's nothing
we can do about that.

1176
01:22:03,974 --> 01:22:05,766
Found a hat.

1177
01:22:05,934 --> 01:22:07,184
She has a thing for hats.

1178
01:22:07,978 --> 01:22:10,312
I was just like that at her age.

1179
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,148
They made me feel safe.

1180
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,318
So how did you meet Dr. Silberman?

1181
01:22:17,654 --> 01:22:20,447
As you can see,
not the same way you did.

1182
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:25,661
My boyfriend asked me
to get them done.

1183
01:22:25,829 --> 01:22:27,079
He's not your husband?

1184
01:22:27,247 --> 01:22:31,709
Oh, no. We are not married.
And probably never will.

1185
01:22:39,468 --> 01:22:41,218
For the boys.

1186
01:22:45,849 --> 01:22:47,975
They seem to like each other, huh?

1187
01:22:48,143 --> 01:22:50,019
She is adorable.

1188
01:22:50,187 --> 01:22:52,229
Yeah, I guess.

1189
01:22:53,523 --> 01:22:56,609
So tell me, Mr. Karpov,
how much did you pay?

1190
01:22:57,194 --> 01:23:01,322
One billion euro. Per seat.

1191
01:23:02,699 --> 01:23:05,451
- That's disgusting.
- Oh, yeah?

1192
01:23:06,328 --> 01:23:10,080
You know, Curtis,
I wasn't always businessman.

1193
01:23:10,248 --> 01:23:12,458
I am a boxer.

1194
01:23:12,626 --> 01:23:16,253
Was my only playing
when I was boy back in Murmansk.

1195
01:23:16,463 --> 01:23:20,841
And my coach,
his name was also Yuri.

1196
01:23:21,009 --> 01:23:22,551
He always said:

1197
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:29,517
"If someone wants to beat you,
he has to kill you first. "

1198
01:23:32,562 --> 01:23:34,146
That's very nice.

1199
01:23:34,314 --> 01:23:35,439
Yeah.

1200
01:23:35,732 --> 01:23:41,320
But tell me, what would you have done
if you rich like me?

1201
01:23:41,488 --> 01:23:45,366
Look.
They are wonderful children, huh?

1202
01:23:46,701 --> 01:23:48,118
Okay, guys.

1203
01:23:48,286 --> 01:23:51,205
The plan is to refuel in Hawaii,
so sit down and buckle up.

1204
01:23:51,873 --> 01:23:54,083
Gordon and I will do the rwst.

1205
01:23:56,753 --> 01:23:57,795
Oh, God.

1206
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:01,423
Go get the guys.

1207
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:07,471
Guys, there's a...
You might wanna...

1208
01:24:26,449 --> 01:24:28,325
What is that?

1209
01:24:28,785 --> 01:24:30,619
The state of Hawaii.

1210
01:24:31,163 --> 01:24:35,040
Not good. That is not good.

1211
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:41,881
How much fuel do we have left?

1212
01:24:42,048 --> 01:24:45,301
Not enough. We're going to
have to make a water landing...

1213
01:24:45,469 --> 01:24:47,470
...somewherw in South China Sea.

1214
01:24:47,637 --> 01:24:50,222
Great. At least we're not gonna need
the landing gear.

1215
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:53,517
- What about it?
- Oh, we lost it all. in Vegas.

1216
01:25:04,905 --> 01:25:06,655
Dr. Wilson, may I come in?

1217
01:25:07,282 --> 01:25:10,993
I'm not very good company,
I'm afraid, Dr...?

1218
01:25:11,203 --> 01:25:13,746
Please, call me Adrian.

1219
01:25:19,419 --> 01:25:21,879
All those people we left behind...

1220
01:25:22,506 --> 01:25:24,965
...they don't stand a chance,
do they?

1221
01:25:26,468 --> 01:25:30,179
I believe that nature
will choose for itself from itself...

1222
01:25:30,347 --> 01:25:31,514
...what will survive.

1223
01:25:33,642 --> 01:25:37,019
Just like you
preserving those great artworks.

1224
01:25:37,604 --> 01:25:40,940
Our culture is our soul,
and that's not dying tonight.

1225
01:25:41,107 --> 01:25:42,775
Oh, come on.

1226
01:25:43,276 --> 01:25:45,611
I contributed to this cover-up.

1227
01:25:45,779 --> 01:25:48,864
And Da Vinci, Picasso, they're in.

1228
01:25:49,032 --> 01:25:51,325
But you're some nobody,
you don't stand a chance.

1229
01:25:51,493 --> 01:25:52,701
That's not...

1230
01:25:53,453 --> 01:25:55,830
That's not necessarily true.

1231
01:25:56,373 --> 01:26:00,709
You ever hear of a writer
called Jackson Curtis?

1232
01:26:00,877 --> 01:26:03,087
Wrote a book, Farewell Atlantis.

1233
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:06,298
What do you think the chances are
of an unknown writer...

1234
01:26:06,466 --> 01:26:10,302
...who barely sold 500 copies,
making it aboard this plane?

1235
01:26:11,304 --> 01:26:12,346
I don't understand.

1236
01:26:12,514 --> 01:26:16,684
I mean, call it chance or fate or nature.
it doesn't matter.

1237
01:26:16,852 --> 01:26:20,396
This book is part of our legacy now.
Why?

1238
01:26:20,814 --> 01:26:22,731
Because I'm reading it.

1239
01:26:26,403 --> 01:26:29,947
Dr. Helmsley, please report
to the Situation Room immediately.

1240
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:46,881
Hello. I'm sorry. Who is this?

1241
01:26:47,048 --> 01:26:50,843
This is Yoko Delgatto.
Do you wanna speak to my daddy?

1242
01:26:54,347 --> 01:26:55,848
Yes, please.

1243
01:26:56,016 --> 01:26:58,267
Who should I say is calling?

1244
01:27:01,605 --> 01:27:04,398
Tell him it's his father.

1245
01:27:04,566 --> 01:27:06,442
You're my grandpa?

1246
01:27:07,527 --> 01:27:09,862
Yes, sweetheart, I am.

1247
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:14,658
Daddy, Daddy,
Grandpa's on the phone.

1248
01:28:17,848 --> 01:28:18,931
Mr. President, sir.

1249
01:28:23,812 --> 01:28:25,437
Mr. President.

1250
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:29,692
- What's the matter, sweetie?
- She can't find her daddy.

1251
01:28:32,404 --> 01:28:34,363
Why don't you two
get comfy on that couch?

1252
01:28:34,531 --> 01:28:37,324
Sally, come help them out, okay?

1253
01:28:38,618 --> 01:28:40,619
I'll find your daddy.

1254
01:28:48,378 --> 01:28:50,045
Who can help me
with missing persons?

1255
01:28:50,213 --> 01:28:52,756
Sorry, man.
I'm really busy right now.

1256
01:28:53,967 --> 01:28:56,886
I mean... Of course, sir.
Sorry, Mr. President.

1257
01:28:57,053 --> 01:28:59,847
Don't worry about it.
You're doing a great job, son.

1258
01:29:26,082 --> 01:29:28,417
- What?
- The capital's been hit by a 9.4.

1259
01:29:28,585 --> 01:29:29,919
We've lost communication.

1260
01:29:30,086 --> 01:29:33,130
- Where's it centered?
- North Chesapeake Bay.

1261
01:29:36,843 --> 01:29:40,513
Mr. Anheuser, the Russian president's
on the line, sir.

1262
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,722
Excuse me.

1263
01:29:42,641 --> 01:29:45,100
We just entered Chinese airspace.

1264
01:29:46,394 --> 01:29:48,270
That's affirmative, Mr. President.

1265
01:29:48,438 --> 01:29:53,150
Until communication is restored,
I suppose I am in command.

1266
01:29:54,110 --> 01:29:56,695
it appears that all other
heads of state are en route...

1267
01:29:56,863 --> 01:29:59,490
...with the exception
of the Italian prime minister...

1268
01:29:59,908 --> 01:30:04,537
...who has also decided
to stay behind and trust in prayer.

1269
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:14,064
The Earth's crust has begun to shift,
Dr. Helmsley.

1270
01:31:14,232 --> 01:31:17,443
- By what degree?
-1.2 degrees, but it's still moving.

1271
01:31:17,611 --> 01:31:18,903
So, what happens next?

1272
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:21,572
Once the movement
of our land masses comes to a halt...

1273
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:23,532
Let's see a simulation, Scotty.

1274
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:25,951
...expect the formation
of gigantic tsunamis...

1275
01:31:26,119 --> 01:31:29,413
...proportional to the magnitude
of the corresponding quakes.

1276
01:31:34,628 --> 01:31:36,462
Pull up the Japanese seaboard,
will you?

1277
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:38,255
Yes, sir.

1278
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,634
My dad's on a cruise ship out here.

1279
01:31:42,594 --> 01:31:45,262
But I guess you already
knew that, huh?

1280
01:31:46,056 --> 01:31:49,725
Sir, we recorded
two underwater quakes at 7.9 and 8.2.

1281
01:32:07,244 --> 01:32:08,786
From what we have just learned...

1282
01:32:08,954 --> 01:32:11,997
...Tokyo seems to have taken
the full force of the earthquake.

1283
01:32:12,165 --> 01:32:14,416
At this point,
unconfirmed reports indicate...

1284
01:32:14,584 --> 01:32:17,503
...that large areas of land
are underwater.

1285
01:32:17,671 --> 01:32:19,839
Please stay tuned for further...

1286
01:32:29,558 --> 01:32:31,225
Tony...

1287
01:32:31,768 --> 01:32:33,352
I called.

1288
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:38,732
I was too late.

1289
01:32:43,155 --> 01:32:46,448
Maybe they got out in time.

1290
01:32:46,616 --> 01:32:48,617
You never know. They...

1291
01:33:16,897 --> 01:33:18,272
Harry!

1292
01:34:15,872 --> 01:34:18,541
I'm coming home, Dorothy.

1293
01:34:44,943 --> 01:34:46,402
Anything?

1294
01:34:47,821 --> 01:34:51,365
Nothing. Just static.
Not even an emergency signal.

1295
01:35:04,713 --> 01:35:06,797
Can't think about
what's going on down there.

1296
01:35:14,222 --> 01:35:16,223
Remember that old Beetle
we used to camp in?

1297
01:35:16,391 --> 01:35:18,267
We could never get the roof up.

1298
01:35:18,435 --> 01:35:20,019
Yeah.

1299
01:35:20,187 --> 01:35:22,104
We definitely traded up.

1300
01:35:25,066 --> 01:35:27,067
Tried to find our old spot
at Yellowstone...

1301
01:35:27,486 --> 01:35:29,445
...when I went camping
with the kids...

1302
01:35:30,655 --> 01:35:32,364
...but I couldn't find it.

1303
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:42,625
Do you think people change?

1304
01:35:43,585 --> 01:35:45,294
By "people," do you mean me?

1305
01:35:45,462 --> 01:35:48,714
Yes. Do you think you've changed
since we separated?

1306
01:35:50,842 --> 01:35:52,802
I certainly eat a lot more cereal now.

1307
01:35:57,265 --> 01:35:59,517
You always had tunnel vision.

1308
01:36:00,268 --> 01:36:03,437
You could just block everything out
and write.

1309
01:36:07,025 --> 01:36:08,818
You blocked us out.

1310
01:36:18,286 --> 01:36:19,703
Do you love him?

1311
01:36:22,499 --> 01:36:24,375
I love him enough.

1312
01:36:36,847 --> 01:36:40,099
All global ground communication
has ceased, sir.

1313
01:36:43,812 --> 01:36:46,147
The only signals our satellites
are picking up...

1314
01:36:46,314 --> 01:36:48,691
...are coming from the vessels
in Cho Ming.

1315
01:36:49,401 --> 01:36:51,443
Well, there's a piece of good news.

1316
01:36:51,611 --> 01:36:52,862
Any updates, doctor?

1317
01:36:53,029 --> 01:36:56,198
We expect the tsunamis
to reach landfall in every continent.

1318
01:36:56,366 --> 01:36:59,869
The Cho Ming area will be impacted
in approximately six hours.

1319
01:37:01,621 --> 01:37:04,665
it looks like the crust has shifted
by almost 23 degrees...

1320
01:37:04,833 --> 01:37:06,625
...to the southwest.

1321
01:37:06,835 --> 01:37:11,714
The data also shows the Earth's poles
have reversed their magnetic fields.

1322
01:37:11,882 --> 01:37:13,299
These are their new positions.

1323
01:37:14,217 --> 01:37:15,718
So you're...

1324
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:18,929
You're telling me
that the North Pole...

1325
01:37:19,473 --> 01:37:21,724
...is now somewhere in Wisconsin?

1326
01:37:21,892 --> 01:37:24,226
Actually, that's the South Pole now.

1327
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:35,279
Engine failure.
Two of the six are down.

1328
01:37:35,447 --> 01:37:37,364
We must get ready.

1329
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:42,328
- How long do we have?
- Fifteen minutes. Maybe.

1330
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:46,790
- Better wake up the kids.
- Yeah.

1331
01:38:26,331 --> 01:38:28,457
Why do you hate Gordon?

1332
01:38:32,379 --> 01:38:34,088
Hey.

1333
01:38:34,464 --> 01:38:36,048
Come on.

1334
01:38:37,384 --> 01:38:39,468
What are you talking about?

1335
01:38:39,636 --> 01:38:40,970
I don't hate him.

1336
01:38:41,138 --> 01:38:42,721
Well, you don't like him, either.

1337
01:38:43,306 --> 01:38:46,058
Well, that's just because
I don't know him that well, maybe.

1338
01:38:46,226 --> 01:38:47,518
Yeah, but I do.

1339
01:38:47,686 --> 01:38:49,979
He's really nice
once you get to know him.

1340
01:38:50,147 --> 01:38:51,772
You should talk to him more often.

1341
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:54,817
You guys would get along
really, really well.

1342
01:38:58,238 --> 01:39:00,030
You like him a lot, huh?

1343
01:39:08,665 --> 01:39:10,374
I'll do my best, I promise.

1344
01:39:10,834 --> 01:39:12,209
Okay?

1345
01:39:13,378 --> 01:39:17,256
I'm really proud of you.
Really, really proud of you.

1346
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:20,176
is it time?

1347
01:39:22,095 --> 01:39:23,387
Yeah.

1348
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,435
- Dad, what's wrong?
- Well, Sasha said we gotta land...

1349
01:39:29,603 --> 01:39:33,314
...and it's gonna be a little bumpy
and maybe a little wet.

1350
01:39:33,482 --> 01:39:34,523
Daddy?

1351
01:39:40,906 --> 01:39:42,114
Hold her steady.

1352
01:40:00,217 --> 01:40:02,510
Daddy,
I'm not a really good swimmer.

1353
01:40:02,677 --> 01:40:06,764
Hey, no, that's all right.
That's what you got this for. Right?

1354
01:40:06,932 --> 01:40:10,017
it's like being in a swimming pool,
only it's got more cool stuff.

1355
01:40:10,185 --> 01:40:13,437
Look, it's got a whistle,
and a light thing. Right?

1356
01:40:13,605 --> 01:40:15,731
I thought we were going to China.

1357
01:40:16,733 --> 01:40:18,818
No, we gotta land here.

1358
01:40:21,822 --> 01:40:24,073
So we're just all gonna
stay together, right?

1359
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:27,201
- No, we're not, we're gonna die.
- No. We're not.

1360
01:40:27,911 --> 01:40:29,370
Promise?

1361
01:40:29,538 --> 01:40:31,622
I promise you
we're gonna all stay together...

1362
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:35,417
...no matter what happens, okay?

1363
01:40:48,598 --> 01:40:50,057
Jackson.

1364
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:51,934
Yuri.

1365
01:40:53,103 --> 01:40:54,895
I think you better come up here.

1366
01:40:55,605 --> 01:40:57,064
I'm gonna go check this out.

1367
01:40:57,232 --> 01:40:59,233
- Dad. Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

1368
01:40:59,401 --> 01:41:02,319
- You said you'd stay with us.
- We gotta buckle up. Let's go.

1369
01:41:03,613 --> 01:41:05,823
Okay, don't ask me
how that happened...

1370
01:41:05,991 --> 01:41:07,449
...but there is no more ocean...

1371
01:41:07,617 --> 01:41:09,660
...and we're close
to where we wanted to go.

1372
01:41:09,828 --> 01:41:12,037
it's like the world shifted
by 1000 miles.

1373
01:41:12,205 --> 01:41:14,790
One thousand five hundrwd
and seventy-eight to be exact.

1374
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:17,334
it's called
Earth Crust Displacement Theory.

1375
01:41:17,544 --> 01:41:19,628
Professor Hapgood, 1958.

1376
01:41:20,505 --> 01:41:21,547
Way to go, Charlie.

1377
01:41:25,635 --> 01:41:26,969
What was that?

1378
01:41:27,971 --> 01:41:30,181
We just lost our last two engines.

1379
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:52,077
I'm gonna shoot for that glacier.
it's gonna get rocky.

1380
01:41:52,245 --> 01:41:56,499
Listen, this is gonna sound crazy,
but here's what you have to do.

1381
01:42:00,128 --> 01:42:02,296
Unbuckle.
Come on, come on, come on.

1382
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,716
Yuri! What are we doing?

1383
01:42:05,884 --> 01:42:08,385
We are taking the Bentley.

1384
01:42:09,971 --> 01:42:12,515
Not yet. Not yet.

1385
01:42:12,682 --> 01:42:14,225
it has to be perfect.

1386
01:42:14,392 --> 01:42:15,976
Almost there.

1387
01:42:16,144 --> 01:42:18,687
- Come on.
- Get in the car.

1388
01:42:28,698 --> 01:42:31,450
Okay, go. Now. Pull.

1389
01:42:36,373 --> 01:42:38,874
No, no, no!

1390
01:42:41,878 --> 01:42:43,295
Go. Go, Jackson.

1391
01:42:43,463 --> 01:42:45,965
No, we gotta wait
for Sasha and Gordon.

1392
01:42:46,132 --> 01:42:49,760
Go. Make sure everybody gets out
of the plane before I touch down.

1393
01:42:49,928 --> 01:42:50,970
What about you?

1394
01:42:51,138 --> 01:42:55,641
I'll be fine.
I have to touch this baby down.

1395
01:42:56,351 --> 01:42:58,060
What are you waiting for?

1396
01:42:58,228 --> 01:43:00,980
Go! Go!

1397
01:43:15,412 --> 01:43:16,787
There he is. I see him.

1398
01:43:16,955 --> 01:43:19,540
- Wherw is Sasha? Wherw is Sasha?
- Come on. Let's go.

1399
01:43:19,708 --> 01:43:22,835
He said he's fine. We should get
out of here before he touches down.

1400
01:43:23,003 --> 01:43:25,171
No, no, no. Don't go.
We have to wait for him.

1401
01:43:25,714 --> 01:43:27,631
Go, Jackson. Go.

1402
01:43:27,799 --> 01:43:31,469
- Don't go!
- it won't start. it won't start.

1403
01:43:31,636 --> 01:43:35,139
Just shut up, everybody!

1404
01:43:36,099 --> 01:43:37,558
Engine...

1405
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:39,351
...start.

1406
01:43:42,772 --> 01:43:45,191
Voice control. Sold me on it.

1407
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,668
Hey! Hey!

1408
01:45:48,565 --> 01:45:50,774
Welcome to
the People's Republic of China.

1409
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:53,527
Good to be here. Say hi, kids.

1410
01:45:53,695 --> 01:45:54,778
- Hi.
- Hi.

1411
01:45:54,946 --> 01:45:56,572
What color are your passes?

1412
01:45:58,241 --> 01:46:00,784
What color
are your boarding passes?

1413
01:46:02,496 --> 01:46:03,662
I have green card.

1414
01:46:04,873 --> 01:46:06,749
For my boys and me.

1415
01:46:06,917 --> 01:46:08,417
What?

1416
01:46:11,838 --> 01:46:14,006
Yuri. Yuri.

1417
01:46:14,174 --> 01:46:17,551
Yuri, it's a mistake. A joke, right?

1418
01:46:17,719 --> 01:46:19,220
What?

1419
01:46:19,554 --> 01:46:22,932
You think I didn't know
about you and Sasha?

1420
01:46:24,684 --> 01:46:27,728
May God bless
that poor bastard's soul.

1421
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:36,195
I'm sorry, guys. Good luck.

1422
01:46:37,614 --> 01:46:39,365
Come on, boys.

1423
01:46:40,992 --> 01:46:43,035
- Does anybody have any money?
- I do, I do.

1424
01:46:43,203 --> 01:46:44,662
You got a billion euros?

1425
01:46:49,668 --> 01:46:50,709
Dr. Wilson?

1426
01:46:51,628 --> 01:46:54,213
I'm Captain Michaels,
skipper of the American ship.

1427
01:46:54,381 --> 01:46:56,632
Please accept my condolences
for your father.

1428
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,551
Thank you, captain.

1429
01:46:59,928 --> 01:47:02,680
Mr. Anheuser,
your party is the last to arrive.

1430
01:47:06,935 --> 01:47:09,270
There've been reports
of severe damage, captain.

1431
01:47:09,437 --> 01:47:11,313
What's the status of Ark Number 3?

1432
01:47:11,481 --> 01:47:13,816
We haven't done
a complete assessment yet...

1433
01:47:13,984 --> 01:47:16,277
...but it looks like we lost it.

1434
01:47:25,871 --> 01:47:28,497
No toothbrush. Only books.

1435
01:47:29,416 --> 01:47:32,835
Yeah, when I was a kid,
my dad was on the road a lot.

1436
01:47:33,461 --> 01:47:35,713
He would always leave me
a box full of books...

1437
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:37,840
...call me every night and quiz me.

1438
01:47:38,425 --> 01:47:41,385
I'd get an ice-cream cone
for every book I read...

1439
01:47:41,553 --> 01:47:42,720
...so I was a fat kid.

1440
01:47:44,347 --> 01:47:46,015
I find that very hard to believe.

1441
01:47:46,183 --> 01:47:47,433
No, it's true.

1442
01:47:47,601 --> 01:47:51,103
My high school career
was 2000 books...

1443
01:47:51,271 --> 01:47:52,980
...and zero girlfriends.

1444
01:47:54,441 --> 01:47:57,359
I didn't even kiss a boy
till I was in college.

1445
01:47:57,736 --> 01:48:00,196
They were all too scared
of my dad.

1446
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,578
Leave it to the Chinese.

1447
01:48:49,746 --> 01:48:51,580
I didn't think it was possible.

1448
01:48:51,748 --> 01:48:53,415
Not in the time we had.

1449
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,459
That's Ark Number 3, sir.

1450
01:48:56,378 --> 01:48:59,672
The roof collapsed on it
during the shifting of the Earth's crust.

1451
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:02,091
Jesus Christ.

1452
01:49:03,301 --> 01:49:06,762
Boarding of Ark Number 3 will be
delayed due to technical difficulties.

1453
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:08,430
- Excuse me.
- We paid a fortune!

1454
01:49:08,598 --> 01:49:11,600
Please be patient
as we keep you updated.

1455
01:49:11,768 --> 01:49:13,602
Hey, what's going on here?

1456
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:16,313
I have a green card
for my boys and me.

1457
01:49:16,523 --> 01:49:18,566
I want to speak to a supervisor.

1458
01:49:18,733 --> 01:49:19,859
I am the supervisor.

1459
01:49:20,026 --> 01:49:23,571
Get back with the other green cards
or I'll have you detained.

1460
01:49:25,532 --> 01:49:27,700
What he said about you and Sasha,
is it true?

1461
01:49:27,868 --> 01:49:31,620
Sasha was worth
100 times a man like Yuri.

1462
01:49:31,788 --> 01:49:34,206
I should have listened to you,
Dr. Silberman.

1463
01:49:34,374 --> 01:49:39,336
I actually liked the way I looked
before that monster talked me into it.

1464
01:49:39,504 --> 01:49:41,797
Did you know he asked me
for a discount?

1465
01:49:41,965 --> 01:49:43,924
And he paid in installments.

1466
01:49:44,092 --> 01:49:45,676
Cheap bastard.

1467
01:49:45,844 --> 01:49:47,428
You hear that?

1468
01:49:50,182 --> 01:49:52,057
Over therw!

1469
01:49:53,602 --> 01:49:55,144
- Hey!
- Hey!

1470
01:49:55,312 --> 01:49:57,521
- Stop! Stop! Please!
- Hey! Hold it!

1471
01:50:01,526 --> 01:50:03,277
Hey! Hey!

1472
01:50:03,778 --> 01:50:06,530
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1473
01:50:07,824 --> 01:50:09,450
Help!

1474
01:50:18,793 --> 01:50:19,919
Hey!

1475
01:50:39,272 --> 01:50:40,856
How were all these people chosen?

1476
01:50:41,024 --> 01:50:43,692
Same way your art was:
By experts from all over the world.

1477
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:46,862
We had geneticists determine
the perfect gene pool to repopulate.

1478
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:48,864
These people
were chosen by geneticists?

1479
01:50:49,032 --> 01:50:52,409
All green-card holders,
please proceed to Gallery D-4.

1480
01:50:52,577 --> 01:50:54,745
Looks like their checkbooks
got them onboard.

1481
01:50:54,913 --> 01:50:57,873
Right. Without billions of dollars
from the private sector...

1482
01:50:58,041 --> 01:50:59,708
...this would've been impossible.

1483
01:50:59,876 --> 01:51:01,961
We sold tickets.

1484
01:51:02,128 --> 01:51:05,589
And what about all these workers?
They all get passes?

1485
01:51:06,216 --> 01:51:10,177
What, life isn't fair? is that it?

1486
01:51:10,345 --> 01:51:13,264
You wanna donate your passes
to a couple of Chinese workers...

1487
01:51:13,431 --> 01:51:15,349
...you be my guest.

1488
01:51:15,809 --> 01:51:19,353
Captain, I want a prelaunch briefing.
All international teams present.

1489
01:51:54,514 --> 01:51:56,348
What the hell?

1490
01:51:59,519 --> 01:52:03,189
What is this?
You could fit 10 people in here.

1491
01:52:09,946 --> 01:52:11,280
Satnam, where are you?

1492
01:52:11,448 --> 01:52:14,241
- On the Nampan Plateau.
- What?

1493
01:52:15,452 --> 01:52:17,786
There's a tidal wave
coming from the east.

1494
01:52:17,954 --> 01:52:21,123
- it's gigantic.
- Satnam, what happened?

1495
01:52:21,291 --> 01:52:23,417
We never got picked up, Adrian.

1496
01:52:23,585 --> 01:52:25,794
The airlift never came.

1497
01:52:27,297 --> 01:52:29,048
Goodbye, my friend.

1498
01:52:29,674 --> 01:52:35,596
Satnam.

1499
01:52:57,494 --> 01:53:00,412
- The flooding is coming this way?
- Mary. Where are we set up?

1500
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:02,039
Over therw.

1501
01:53:05,669 --> 01:53:07,795
Get me the satellite images
from Nampan, India.

1502
01:53:07,963 --> 01:53:09,672
- Okay, right away.
- What's happening?

1503
01:53:10,966 --> 01:53:13,592
No. Satnam was talking
about another wave...

1504
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,261
...coming from the east.

1505
01:53:18,849 --> 01:53:21,308
- Holy mother.
- The flooding is gonna hit earlier?

1506
01:53:21,476 --> 01:53:24,186
is that what you're telling me?
The second wave is closer?

1507
01:53:24,354 --> 01:53:26,313
- Plug in the new data.
- Okay.

1508
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,733
- Satnam didn't get picked up.
- What?

1509
01:53:30,152 --> 01:53:32,987
A lot of people didn't get picked up
in this chaos.

1510
01:53:33,155 --> 01:53:34,780
This is not a conspiracy, Helmsley.

1511
01:53:35,198 --> 01:53:38,242
Your predictions haven't exactly
panned out, have they, doctor?

1512
01:53:38,410 --> 01:53:40,327
it's ready. it's ready.

1513
01:53:42,247 --> 01:53:44,248
Oh, God. it's 1500 meters high.

1514
01:53:45,792 --> 01:53:48,961
When's it gonna get here? Talk to me,
Helmsley. When's it gonna hit?

1515
01:53:49,129 --> 01:53:50,796
Adjust the countdown.

1516
01:54:06,938 --> 01:54:09,815
Twenty-eight minutes,
10 seconds to impact.

1517
01:54:09,983 --> 01:54:11,233
Oh, my God.

1518
01:54:11,401 --> 01:54:14,862
Captain, I need to speak to the other
heads of state immediately.

1519
01:54:15,030 --> 01:54:17,823
- Right away. Taylor?
- Aye, captain. Standing by.

1520
01:54:17,991 --> 01:54:20,576
Ark 6, stand by. Ark 7, stand by.

1521
01:54:20,744 --> 01:54:23,412
- Carl Anheuser, acting CIC, Ark 4.
- Yes, sir.

1522
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:25,873
Requesting emergency conference,
T-99.

1523
01:54:46,895 --> 01:54:49,355
He thinks the world of you,
you know that?

1524
01:54:51,274 --> 01:54:53,025
He's a great little man.

1525
01:54:53,902 --> 01:54:55,444
Yeah.

1526
01:55:03,453 --> 01:55:06,080
I always wanted to have a family
of my own.

1527
01:55:09,668 --> 01:55:11,919
You're a lucky man, Jackson.

1528
01:55:12,587 --> 01:55:14,463
Don't ever forget it.

1529
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:31,564
Who are they?

1530
01:55:31,731 --> 01:55:33,440
We found them along side
of the road.

1531
01:55:34,109 --> 01:55:35,151
Send them back!

1532
01:55:41,658 --> 01:55:43,200
I am a follower...

1533
01:55:44,119 --> 01:55:45,828
...of our great Lama Rinpoche.

1534
01:55:46,621 --> 01:55:48,038
You know I cannot do that.

1535
01:55:48,206 --> 01:55:49,748
What's the problem?

1536
01:55:49,916 --> 01:55:51,584
You don't have to take all of us.

1537
01:55:51,751 --> 01:55:53,711
Just take my children.
I'm begging you.

1538
01:55:54,212 --> 01:55:55,880
Why should I do that?

1539
01:55:56,047 --> 01:55:59,258
The same reason
you sent for your family.

1540
01:55:59,426 --> 01:56:00,468
Please.

1541
01:56:00,635 --> 01:56:03,053
Just the children.
You don't have to take us.

1542
01:56:03,221 --> 01:56:04,346
Please!

1543
01:56:07,184 --> 01:56:09,351
Please. Oh, my God.

1544
01:56:12,856 --> 01:56:16,859
Please. I don't know
if you can understand what I'm saying.

1545
01:56:17,027 --> 01:56:19,111
As a mother, I'm begging you.

1546
01:56:19,279 --> 01:56:21,030
Please take them.

1547
01:56:21,907 --> 01:56:23,282
Please.

1548
01:56:25,660 --> 01:56:29,455
We are all children of the earth.

1549
01:56:29,623 --> 01:56:33,125
My plan will not work for so many,
Grandma.

1550
01:56:33,293 --> 01:56:37,213
We will take them all.

1551
01:56:39,925 --> 01:56:41,467
Please.

1552
01:56:43,386 --> 01:56:46,096
Thank you. Thank you.

1553
01:56:53,063 --> 01:56:55,898
Attention: All construction workers,
off deck.

1554
01:56:56,316 --> 01:56:59,193
All crew members, onboard now.

1555
01:56:59,361 --> 01:57:01,111
They're opening the mountain.

1556
01:57:01,571 --> 01:57:04,323
They are leaving without us.

1557
01:57:04,491 --> 01:57:07,785
Step back. Get back.
What did I tell you?

1558
01:57:07,953 --> 01:57:10,871
They are leaving you behind too.
Look, idiot.

1559
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:13,123
Please be patient.

1560
01:57:15,752 --> 01:57:17,253
Let's go.

1561
01:57:20,298 --> 01:57:26,971
Follow me.

1562
01:57:33,603 --> 01:57:34,728
We have to hurry!

1563
01:57:35,355 --> 01:57:36,564
They are leaving!

1564
01:57:39,234 --> 01:57:41,235
initiate security procedures.

1565
01:57:41,403 --> 01:57:46,031
Time to impact:
17 minutes, 42 seconds.

1566
01:57:47,033 --> 01:57:49,577
Oh, excuse me.
Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?

1567
01:57:49,744 --> 01:57:51,162
He's on the bridge. This way.

1568
01:57:55,625 --> 01:57:56,625
Tenzin wait!

1569
01:57:58,211 --> 01:58:00,212
Grandma, we're almost there.

1570
01:58:00,380 --> 01:58:02,298
Green lights on pressure,
Mr. Anton?

1571
01:58:02,465 --> 01:58:04,508
Green lights across the board,
captain.

1572
01:58:16,271 --> 01:58:17,646
Why do they have anchors?

1573
01:58:17,814 --> 01:58:21,108
Because they're not spaceships,
buddy. They're arks.

1574
01:58:21,276 --> 01:58:22,860
Let's go.

1575
01:58:35,165 --> 01:58:36,207
Mr. President.

1576
01:58:37,167 --> 01:58:38,250
You've got to see this.

1577
01:59:07,864 --> 01:59:08,906
Stop.

1578
01:59:09,074 --> 01:59:10,699
Stop! Stop!

1579
01:59:12,118 --> 01:59:13,160
Stop!

1580
01:59:19,751 --> 01:59:21,252
Engage the support mechanisms.

1581
01:59:21,419 --> 01:59:23,629
Aye, aye, captain.
Engaging bow-anchor supports.

1582
01:59:23,797 --> 01:59:26,590
How long are these things expecting
to hold us in place?

1583
01:59:26,758 --> 01:59:29,718
They're just meant to withstand
the first impact of the waves.

1584
01:59:49,447 --> 01:59:51,782
Down there Oleg, you go first!

1585
01:59:56,288 --> 02:00:15,514
Caesar.

1586
02:00:18,351 --> 02:00:19,810
Good. Good boy.

1587
02:00:20,270 --> 02:00:22,438
Come to Mommy. Caesar!

1588
02:00:23,732 --> 02:00:25,608
Mom, where's Tamara?

1589
02:00:27,903 --> 02:00:29,153
Daddy look!

1590
02:00:30,572 --> 02:00:32,656
Come on. Caesar, come on.

1591
02:00:32,824 --> 02:00:34,533
- Tamara!
- I'm coming.

1592
02:00:42,501 --> 02:00:44,126
Take him.

1593
02:01:10,862 --> 02:01:12,696
Oh, my God.
What's happening out there?

1594
02:01:12,864 --> 02:01:14,365
Anheuser.

1595
02:01:14,908 --> 02:01:18,494
Anheuser convinced
the other heads of state to launch.

1596
02:01:21,665 --> 02:01:23,290
Mr. Anheuser.

1597
02:01:25,001 --> 02:01:27,461
We have to stop this madness.

1598
02:01:28,004 --> 02:01:30,339
Make sure the other bridges
can see me.

1599
02:01:30,674 --> 02:01:34,176
- What do you think you're doing?
- I know what I'm doing. Turn it on.

1600
02:01:35,262 --> 02:01:37,555
Ladies and gentlemen,
this Dr. Adrian Helmsley...

1601
02:01:37,722 --> 02:01:40,349
...chief science advisor
to the late President Wilson.

1602
02:01:40,517 --> 02:01:43,561
Could you please turn up the volume,
Mr. Hoffmann?

1603
02:01:43,812 --> 02:01:46,188
We've all been forced
to make difficult decisions...

1604
02:01:46,356 --> 02:01:48,107
...to save our human civilization.

1605
02:01:48,275 --> 02:01:50,818
But to be human
means to care for each other...

1606
02:01:50,986 --> 02:01:54,905
...and civilization means
to work together to create a better life.

1607
02:01:55,073 --> 02:01:57,533
If that's true,
then there's nothing human...

1608
02:01:57,701 --> 02:02:00,995
...and nothing civilized
about what we're doing here.

1609
02:02:01,163 --> 02:02:03,497
Dr. Helmsley's passion is admirable.

1610
02:02:03,665 --> 02:02:07,626
But I will remind you that we have very
limited resources and limited time.

1611
02:02:07,794 --> 02:02:12,298
Ask yourselves, can we really stand by
and watch these people die?

1612
02:02:13,425 --> 02:02:15,050
I read a quote two days ago.

1613
02:02:15,218 --> 02:02:17,803
The author is probably dead by now,
but he said:

1614
02:02:17,971 --> 02:02:20,181
"The moment we stop fighting
for each other...

1615
02:02:20,348 --> 02:02:23,476
...that's the moment
that we lose our humanity. "

1616
02:02:23,643 --> 02:02:24,977
To save the human race...

1617
02:02:25,145 --> 02:02:27,480
...we have an obligation
to stick to this plan...

1618
02:02:27,647 --> 02:02:30,316
...which every nation on this flotilla
has signed up for.

1619
02:02:30,484 --> 02:02:33,527
- We have to let these people in!
- They're in God's hands now.

1620
02:02:35,197 --> 02:02:36,864
Officer, you turn that off.

1621
02:02:38,742 --> 02:02:40,242
That is an order. Turn it off!

1622
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:41,911
Don't you dare touch that button.

1623
02:02:42,078 --> 02:02:44,914
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1624
02:02:45,081 --> 02:02:48,417
Look at the clock.
We have barely 15 minutes left.

1625
02:02:48,585 --> 02:02:51,587
Do you wanna be responsible
for the extinction of the human race?

1626
02:02:51,755 --> 02:02:53,214
Can you handle that, Adrian?

1627
02:02:53,381 --> 02:02:55,549
There's a young astrophysicist
from India...

1628
02:02:55,717 --> 02:02:58,385
- ... who's the reason we're all here.
- Oh, for God's sake.

1629
02:02:59,054 --> 02:03:02,431
He's the one who discovered it all.
He connected all the dots.

1630
02:03:02,599 --> 02:03:05,100
We all owe him our lives.

1631
02:03:05,268 --> 02:03:07,728
I just learned
that he was killed with his family...

1632
02:03:07,896 --> 02:03:10,689
...in a tsunami in eastern India.

1633
02:03:12,609 --> 02:03:13,984
He was my friend.

1634
02:03:15,278 --> 02:03:17,196
And he died in vain.

1635
02:03:17,823 --> 02:03:21,075
Everybody out there
has died in vain...

1636
02:03:21,243 --> 02:03:25,538
...if we start our future
with an act of cruelty.

1637
02:03:26,581 --> 02:03:28,707
What will you tell your children?

1638
02:03:30,126 --> 02:03:32,211
What will they tell theirs?

1639
02:03:34,548 --> 02:03:38,175
If my father were here,
he would open the gates.

1640
02:03:45,475 --> 02:03:46,851
The people of Russia...

1641
02:03:49,062 --> 02:03:50,229
...along with China...

1642
02:03:52,482 --> 02:03:55,484
...and Japan, agree.

1643
02:03:56,528 --> 02:03:58,445
Open the gates.

1644
02:04:00,490 --> 02:04:04,535
The United Kingdom,
Spain, France, Canada, Germany...

1645
02:04:04,703 --> 02:04:09,165
...and I believe I may also speak
for the Italian prime minister...

1646
02:04:09,332 --> 02:04:12,084
...we vote to let these people
come in.

1647
02:04:18,175 --> 02:04:19,842
Captain Michaels.

1648
02:04:21,386 --> 02:04:22,553
Please.

1649
02:04:26,475 --> 02:04:28,017
This is the captain.

1650
02:04:28,185 --> 02:04:30,769
in a few moments,
we will open the gates...

1651
02:04:30,937 --> 02:04:32,730
...and get you people in.

1652
02:04:32,898 --> 02:04:36,442
Please step back
and clear the platform.

1653
02:04:38,904 --> 02:04:41,238
P- yew, it stinks.

1654
02:05:00,175 --> 02:05:02,551
- They are opening the gates.
- Go. Go.

1655
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:05,054
Climb! Don't look down! Climb! Go!

1656
02:05:05,222 --> 02:05:06,889
Noah. Noah.

1657
02:05:07,057 --> 02:05:08,224
Get down.

1658
02:05:18,235 --> 02:05:20,027
Mom. Mom, something happened.

1659
02:05:20,195 --> 02:05:21,403
Hold on! Hold on!

1660
02:05:24,241 --> 02:05:25,282
Hold on!

1661
02:05:27,702 --> 02:05:29,995
Gordon, hold on, goddamn it!
Give me your hand!

1662
02:05:30,163 --> 02:05:31,705
- Give me your hand. Reach!
- Help!

1663
02:05:31,873 --> 02:05:33,999
- Reach for it! Gordon!
- Please. Please. Please.

1664
02:05:34,668 --> 02:05:36,168
Gordon! Gordon!

1665
02:05:37,295 --> 02:05:38,462
Gordon!

1666
02:05:39,506 --> 02:05:40,756
No!

1667
02:05:41,716 --> 02:05:43,217
God.

1668
02:05:55,230 --> 02:05:56,272
Pull me up.

1669
02:05:57,232 --> 02:05:58,649
Come on!

1670
02:06:23,341 --> 02:06:24,675
What's wrong with the gate?

1671
02:06:24,843 --> 02:06:27,845
Looks like it didn't run the full cycle.
We're checking, captain.

1672
02:06:28,555 --> 02:06:29,638
Hold it.

1673
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:31,682
Hold it, people.

1674
02:06:36,271 --> 02:06:38,814
Four minutes to impact.

1675
02:07:22,734 --> 02:07:24,276
Go to the lower deck. Let's go.

1676
02:07:24,444 --> 02:07:27,279
- We are loaded, captain.
- Well, then let's lock it up. Now.

1677
02:07:37,499 --> 02:07:40,543
Oleg. Grab my hand.

1678
02:07:40,961 --> 02:07:42,002
Oleg.

1679
02:07:42,963 --> 02:07:44,255
No, no.

1680
02:07:52,806 --> 02:07:55,641
Papa! Papa!

1681
02:08:00,147 --> 02:08:01,647
Papa!

1682
02:08:12,951 --> 02:08:16,287
- Something's jamming the hydraulics.
- Then get it out, for Chris sake.

1683
02:08:16,454 --> 02:08:19,456
I can't fire up the engines
till we get a good seal on that gate.

1684
02:08:19,624 --> 02:08:22,001
Captain, we have a breach
in the zoological bay.

1685
02:08:22,169 --> 02:08:24,461
- Can you zoom in?
- Yeah.

1686
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:29,633
I know those kids.

1687
02:08:29,801 --> 02:08:31,802
What is happening?
What's going on?

1688
02:08:31,970 --> 02:08:33,929
Where did they come from?

1689
02:08:35,891 --> 02:08:37,683
There.
Through the hydraulic chamber.

1690
02:08:37,851 --> 02:08:39,602
Captain,
I think we found the problem.

1691
02:08:39,769 --> 02:08:41,270
- Who are these people?
- No, wait.

1692
02:08:42,272 --> 02:08:44,398
He's injured.
Something must have gone wrong.

1693
02:08:44,566 --> 02:08:47,318
Something must have gone wrong?
Something must have gone...?

1694
02:08:47,486 --> 02:08:50,029
Are you kidding me?
Of course something went wrong!

1695
02:08:50,197 --> 02:08:52,072
You know,
congratulations to both of you.

1696
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:55,784
Might of gotten us killed, but as long
as your conscience is clean.

1697
02:08:55,952 --> 02:08:59,330
Let's get a team down there. I'll meet
them at the hydraulics chamber.

1698
02:08:59,498 --> 02:09:00,664
- You know your way?
- Yeah.

1699
02:09:00,832 --> 02:09:03,751
- Let's go!
- One minute to impact.

1700
02:09:17,474 --> 02:09:21,060
Captain,
Cho Ming Airfield's been hit.

1701
02:09:21,228 --> 02:09:22,978
Put me on emergency com,
Mr. Taylor.

1702
02:09:23,146 --> 02:09:25,481
Aye. You're on, captain.

1703
02:09:25,649 --> 02:09:27,066
This is the captain speaking.

1704
02:09:28,151 --> 02:09:30,820
We expect to be impacted
by water shortly.

1705
02:09:30,987 --> 02:09:33,113
- We need to go this way.
- All new passengers:

1706
02:09:33,281 --> 02:09:35,741
- Hit the deck, brace yourselves.
- Okay, let's go!

1707
02:09:35,909 --> 02:09:38,911
Excuse me. Excuse us. Excuse us.
Brace yourselves!

1708
02:09:39,079 --> 02:09:40,287
Coming through, excuse me.

1709
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:56,637
All stations, prepare for impact.

1710
02:10:26,877 --> 02:10:28,335
Come on, boys. Go, go, go!

1711
02:10:28,503 --> 02:10:30,963
This way! Let's go! Go, go!

1712
02:10:42,392 --> 02:10:44,643
Collision pressure
just below 80 pascal, captain.

1713
02:10:44,811 --> 02:10:47,354
0.2 mil surface compression
on bow sensors, captain.

1714
02:10:47,522 --> 02:10:50,858
- All right, track Dr. Helmsley.
- There.

1715
02:10:52,986 --> 02:10:54,028
Come on.

1716
02:10:54,196 --> 02:10:55,654
- I got you!
- Get out of the way!

1717
02:10:55,822 --> 02:10:57,698
- We have to get through here.
- Excuse me.

1718
02:10:58,909 --> 02:11:00,784
Tenzin, almost there.

1719
02:11:01,912 --> 02:11:03,454
Nima, what happened?

1720
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:08,584
Tamara. Will you take the kids
to the stairs, please?

1721
02:11:09,294 --> 02:11:12,296
- Which way?
- We can't get there.

1722
02:11:12,464 --> 02:11:14,757
Water has penetrated the stern.

1723
02:11:14,925 --> 02:11:18,511
The rear of the ship is starting to seal
itself up one compartment at a time!

1724
02:11:19,346 --> 02:11:21,096
Wherw's Gordon?

1725
02:11:21,932 --> 02:11:23,015
No?

1726
02:11:23,558 --> 02:11:24,934
No.

1727
02:11:25,101 --> 02:11:29,146
We gotta go back. We gotta go back!
We need to go back!

1728
02:11:30,232 --> 02:11:33,108
- No! Lilly!
- Mommy!

1729
02:11:33,568 --> 02:11:36,529
- Lilly!
- Help, Daddy!

1730
02:11:38,073 --> 02:11:40,533
Run, Lilly! Run!

1731
02:11:41,076 --> 02:11:44,245
Lilly, run! Go, go!

1732
02:11:45,247 --> 02:11:46,789
Go over, Lilly.

1733
02:11:49,751 --> 02:11:51,377
Caesar. Lilly, take him.

1734
02:11:54,422 --> 02:11:55,673
Mommy!

1735
02:11:57,634 --> 02:11:59,677
Oh, no.

1736
02:12:02,848 --> 02:12:05,599
Sir, is there another way
to the hydraulics chamber?

1737
02:12:05,767 --> 02:12:08,435
- Where does this ladder go?
- To the zoological bay!

1738
02:12:08,603 --> 02:12:10,437
Okay, okay, let's go.

1739
02:12:15,944 --> 02:12:16,986
Professor...

1740
02:12:17,821 --> 02:12:19,655
...it's Air Force One.

1741
02:12:37,257 --> 02:12:39,758
- The mid-ship anchor is hit.
- We're destabilizing.

1742
02:12:39,926 --> 02:12:41,218
The bow anchor's giving in.

1743
02:13:00,822 --> 02:13:02,698
Captain,
the turbine's not responding.

1744
02:13:02,866 --> 02:13:05,701
So override it. Hit the override button
and start the engines.

1745
02:13:05,869 --> 02:13:08,996
We can't start the engine
until we close that gate.

1746
02:13:26,598 --> 02:13:28,641
Help me! Help!

1747
02:13:33,814 --> 02:13:37,149
Tamara!

1748
02:13:38,235 --> 02:13:40,945
- You okay?
- My mommy's in there. Help her.

1749
02:13:41,112 --> 02:13:43,572
We'll get to your mommy.
They're doing everything they can.

1750
02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:46,200
- Can we talk to them?
- I'm gonna try and connect us.

1751
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:50,287
- We have to stop the bleeding.
- Mom, how about my belt?

1752
02:13:50,455 --> 02:13:52,832
Mr. Curtis! Jackson!

1753
02:13:52,999 --> 02:13:54,166
Hey!

1754
02:13:54,334 --> 02:13:56,377
Help! Hey!

1755
02:13:56,545 --> 02:13:58,546
it's Adrian Helmsley.
We met at Yellowstone.

1756
02:13:58,713 --> 02:14:00,840
That's great!
Open the goddamn door!

1757
02:14:01,007 --> 02:14:02,299
Your daughter is with me!

1758
02:14:02,467 --> 02:14:04,885
- Lilly!
- Lilly!

1759
02:14:05,053 --> 02:14:07,888
- Where's Noah?
- I'm right here, Lil.

1760
02:14:08,431 --> 02:14:09,974
impact warning.

1761
02:14:10,142 --> 02:14:12,017
Thirty degrees west.

1762
02:14:12,185 --> 02:14:13,936
Forty-five degrees east.

1763
02:14:14,104 --> 02:14:17,606
Target elevation, 29,035 feet.

1764
02:14:17,774 --> 02:14:20,568
Twenty-nine thousand feet?
What the hell is at 29,000 feet?

1765
02:14:20,735 --> 02:14:22,987
We're headed straight
for the north face...

1766
02:14:23,155 --> 02:14:25,322
...of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.

1767
02:14:25,490 --> 02:14:30,077
And if we can't start our engines,
we will not survive the impact.

1768
02:14:39,963 --> 02:14:42,882
Jackson, you're sealed off.
We can't get to you!

1769
02:14:43,049 --> 02:14:44,967
There's something blocking
the hydraulics.

1770
02:14:45,135 --> 02:14:48,387
If you can't get it out,
none of us are gonna make it.

1771
02:14:48,889 --> 02:14:51,307
Dr. Helmsley, look at this.

1772
02:14:51,766 --> 02:14:53,476
it is completely submerged
down there.

1773
02:14:53,643 --> 02:14:55,269
There'd be no way to get any air.

1774
02:14:56,021 --> 02:14:59,648
- There's no other way.
- But it's a suicide mission, sir.

1775
02:15:06,698 --> 02:15:09,325
I know where it is, I'll give it a try.

1776
02:15:15,749 --> 02:15:18,584
- Dad. Wait, I wanna go with you.
- No, Noah.

1777
02:15:18,752 --> 02:15:21,629
- Dad. I wanna help you.
- No, no. You are helping me, buddy.

1778
02:15:21,796 --> 02:15:22,838
Dad, please.

1779
02:15:23,006 --> 02:15:25,090
Remember when Lilly was born...

1780
02:15:25,258 --> 02:15:27,760
...and you wanted to be introduced
as her big brother?

1781
02:15:27,928 --> 02:15:31,013
Well, she's scared now,
and she needs you more than ever.

1782
02:15:31,181 --> 02:15:32,181
And if you're safe...

1783
02:15:32,349 --> 02:15:34,725
...I know that she's safe.
Do you understand?

1784
02:15:41,233 --> 02:15:43,734
You can help me out the next time.

1785
02:15:43,902 --> 02:15:45,152
Come on.

1786
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:48,072
Kate, we caused this thing,
it was us.

1787
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:50,825
- Gotta go check it out.
- Okay.

1788
02:16:03,213 --> 02:16:04,630
I love you.

1789
02:16:19,104 --> 02:16:22,064
Please! Can you hear me?

1790
02:16:26,236 --> 02:16:31,490
Help!

1791
02:16:54,014 --> 02:16:57,516
Press down.
Press down with your hand.

1792
02:17:05,150 --> 02:17:06,775
Don't stop. Keep pressing.

1793
02:17:24,377 --> 02:17:25,419
Noah!

1794
02:17:30,050 --> 02:17:34,011
Distance to impact: 1850 meters.

1795
02:17:37,098 --> 02:17:38,265
There he is!

1796
02:17:39,643 --> 02:17:41,310
Captain, we have a visual!

1797
02:17:41,478 --> 02:17:44,647
- I think we found the problem.
- Show us the hydraulic chamber!

1798
02:18:01,998 --> 02:18:04,375
Goddamn it,
I told you to stay up there with Mom.

1799
02:18:04,543 --> 02:18:05,960
I just wanted to help.

1800
02:18:06,127 --> 02:18:07,795
All right, all right.

1801
02:18:07,963 --> 02:18:09,088
You hold the light...

1802
02:18:09,256 --> 02:18:11,757
...but from right here,
right in the air pocket, okay?

1803
02:18:12,259 --> 02:18:14,176
You're a crazy little dude.

1804
02:18:18,849 --> 02:18:20,266
Grandma, Grandpa.

1805
02:18:20,767 --> 02:18:22,393
I'm sorry.

1806
02:18:22,811 --> 02:18:26,689
- I could not save us.
- He has gone back in. He will fix it.

1807
02:18:28,024 --> 02:18:30,317
There's no way.

1808
02:18:31,528 --> 02:18:33,529
Don't lose your faith, brother.

1809
02:19:01,141 --> 02:19:02,808
Dad!

1810
02:19:09,357 --> 02:19:12,943
No, we lost him.
We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

1811
02:19:34,174 --> 02:19:36,759
Great job.
You light the way, I'll go for the cable.

1812
02:19:36,927 --> 02:19:37,968
Okay.

1813
02:19:38,136 --> 02:19:41,013
Distance to impact: 400 meters.

1814
02:19:41,181 --> 02:19:44,016
Underwater ridge ahead.
We're going to run aground, captain.

1815
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:03,202
Yeah!

1816
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:17,049
- Sir, the gate is sealed.
- That's affirmative, captain.

1817
02:20:17,217 --> 02:20:19,093
Anton, start the engine.

1818
02:20:19,261 --> 02:20:21,011
Aye, aye, captain. Full reverse.

1819
02:20:29,938 --> 02:20:34,150
- Too fast! We're not gonna make it.
- Distance to impact: 50 meters.

1820
02:20:34,818 --> 02:20:36,068
Forty meters.

1821
02:20:59,759 --> 02:21:01,886
Reverse motion activated.

1822
02:21:02,053 --> 02:21:05,514
Distance to impact: 10 meters.

1823
02:21:06,141 --> 02:21:07,308
Twenty meters.

1824
02:21:15,901 --> 02:21:17,234
Yes!

1825
02:21:22,115 --> 02:21:24,408
- Hard to port.
- Aye, captain. Hard to port.

1826
02:21:35,795 --> 02:21:37,838
We did it. We did it. We did it.

1827
02:21:38,882 --> 02:21:41,217
- Where's your dad?
- He was right behind me.

1828
02:21:42,636 --> 02:21:45,513
Any word from the hydraulic chamber?
Where is he?

1829
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:47,389
I thought you said
he was behind you.

1830
02:21:47,557 --> 02:21:49,099
- He was.
- Are you sure?

1831
02:21:49,267 --> 02:21:51,435
Yeah. He was right there.

1832
02:22:00,028 --> 02:22:03,572
Dad.

1833
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:05,449
Come on, Jackson. Come on.

1834
02:22:09,913 --> 02:22:13,040
Please, God. Please, please.

1835
02:22:14,584 --> 02:22:17,086
Please, please, please.

1836
02:22:17,796 --> 02:22:19,421
Come on, Jackson.

1837
02:22:24,136 --> 02:22:25,594
Oh, my...

1838
02:22:34,771 --> 02:22:36,272
- He did it!
- Daddy!

1839
02:22:36,439 --> 02:22:40,025
- He did it!
- He did it.

1840
02:23:36,249 --> 02:23:39,418
"Shuttle Atlantis. Our last day.

1841
02:23:39,586 --> 02:23:42,463
All we can hear is the sound
of our own breathing...

1842
02:23:42,631 --> 02:23:48,302
...that reminds us we are still sharing
our memories, hopes and ideas.

1843
02:23:48,512 --> 02:23:52,139
And isn't it funny, just this morning,
we worked it out:

1844
02:23:52,307 --> 02:23:56,894
Somehow or another,
we all have relatives in Wisconsin.

1845
02:23:59,439 --> 02:24:00,856
The end. "

1846
02:24:10,867 --> 02:24:12,201
it's good.

1847
02:24:13,078 --> 02:24:15,037
I thought you'd like it.

1848
02:24:16,456 --> 02:24:17,665
Tell me, Dr. Wilson...

1849
02:24:17,833 --> 02:24:21,126
...apart from books and art...

1850
02:24:22,295 --> 02:24:27,842
...do you think there's anything else
we might possibly share in the future?

1851
02:24:28,927 --> 02:24:32,930
Are you asking me out on a date,
Dr. Helmsley?

1852
02:24:33,598 --> 02:24:36,225
Because, you know,
my diary is pretty full.

1853
02:24:37,602 --> 02:24:39,145
Actually...

1854
02:24:42,065 --> 02:24:43,899
...yes, I was.

1855
02:24:48,071 --> 02:24:50,573
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge, please.

1856
02:24:51,032 --> 02:24:52,408
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge.

1857
02:24:55,287 --> 02:24:56,829
Come herw.

1858
02:25:02,919 --> 02:25:05,963
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Michaels speaking.

1859
02:25:06,131 --> 02:25:09,592
in a few minutes I will give orders
to unseal the decks.

1860
02:25:09,759 --> 02:25:12,887
- Come on.
- At 2345 last night...

1861
02:25:13,054 --> 02:25:17,224
...our sister arks, Numbers 6 and 7,
have joined our course.

1862
02:25:18,727 --> 02:25:20,436
For the first time on ourjourney...

1863
02:25:20,604 --> 02:25:23,606
...we'll have clear skies
and moderate-to-good air quality.

1864
02:25:23,773 --> 02:25:27,067
As you know, our passenger count
is way over capacity.

1865
02:25:27,235 --> 02:25:29,695
So please be careful
when you step out.

1866
02:25:29,863 --> 02:25:33,616
And of course, enjoy the fresh air.

1867
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:36,785
Can I hold him?

1868
02:25:37,496 --> 02:25:40,122
Sure. He can be your dog too,
if you like.

1869
02:25:40,290 --> 02:25:41,457
Thanks.

1870
02:25:45,545 --> 02:25:48,923
- Where have you been all my life?
- Gift shop.

1871
02:26:45,772 --> 02:26:48,190
Oh, Adrian, excellent.

1872
02:26:48,608 --> 02:26:51,360
I called because we just got
our first satellite feed.

1873
02:26:51,528 --> 02:26:54,029
The equalization
of the oceanic seabeds...

1874
02:26:54,197 --> 02:26:56,699
...has not turned out
to be as extreme as we expected.

1875
02:26:56,867 --> 02:27:00,536
The waters are receding much faster
than we thought, thank God.

1876
02:27:00,704 --> 02:27:02,496
And this is hard to believe...

1877
02:27:02,664 --> 02:27:05,708
...but the Himalayas
are no longer the roof of the world.

1878
02:27:05,876 --> 02:27:09,128
it's now the Drakensberg mountains
of KwaZulu-Natal.

1879
02:27:09,296 --> 02:27:11,380
The entire African continent
has risen.

1880
02:27:11,548 --> 02:27:14,508
Several thousand feet,
and it likely never even flooded.

1881
02:27:14,676 --> 02:27:17,052
That's why they call it
the Cape of Good Hope.

1882
02:27:17,220 --> 02:27:19,013
We've already set course for it.

1883
02:27:26,188 --> 02:27:28,105
Daddy,
when will we go back home?

1884
02:27:28,940 --> 02:27:30,232
Well, we talked about that.

1885
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:34,069
We're gonna find a new home
out here somewhere, right?

1886
02:27:34,237 --> 02:27:36,989
I mean, wherever we're all together,
that's home.

1887
02:27:37,157 --> 02:27:39,450
Right? Don't be scared.

1888
02:27:39,618 --> 02:27:41,243
I'm not.

1889
02:27:43,038 --> 02:27:44,580
No more Pull-Ups.

1890
02:27:47,918 --> 02:27:49,376
Nice.
